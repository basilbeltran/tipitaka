<h3>I. Talk on Wanderers (<i>Paribb&#257;jakakath&#257;</i>)</h3>
<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-1'>1.</a></span> Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Exalted One was travelling along the highway between R&#257;jagaha and N&#257;land&#257; together with a great company of bhikkhus, with about five hundred bhikkhus. At the same time the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling along the highway between R&#257;jagaha and N&#257;land&#257; together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta. Along the way, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. But his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. Thus these two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-2'>2.</a></span> Then the Exalted One together with the company of bhikkhus entered the royal resthouse in the Ambala&#7789;&#7789;hika garden in order to pass the night. The wanderer Suppiya together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, also entered the royal resthouse in the Ambala&#7789;&#7789;hika garden in order to pass the night. There, too, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his pupil Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise. Thus these two, teacher and pupil, dwelt together making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-3'>3.</a></span> When dawn broke a number of bhikkhus, after rising, assembled in the pavilion. As they sat together, the following conversation sprang up among them: "It is wonderful and marvellous, friends, how the Exalted One, he who knows and sees, the Worthy One, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his own pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in their praise. These two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other."</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-4'>4.</a></span> Then the Exalted One, realizing the turn their discussion had taken, entered the pavilion, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the bhikkhus: "What kind of discussion were you holding just now, bhikkhus? What was the subject of your conversation?"</p>

<p>The bhikkhus replied: "When dawn had broken, Lord, after rising we assembled in the pavilion. As we sat here, the following conversation sprang up among us: 'It is wonderful and marvellous friends, how the Exalted One, he who knows and sees, the Worthy One, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, while his own pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in their praise. These two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.' This, Lord, was the conversation we were having when the Exalted One arrived."</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-5'>5.</a></span> "If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart. For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If you were to become angry or upset when others speak in dispraise of us, would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Lord."</p>

<p>"If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should unravel what is false and point it out as false, saying: 'For such and such a reason this is false, this is untrue, there is no such thing in us, this is not found among us.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-6'>6.</a></span> "And if, bhikkhus, others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should not give way to jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart. For if you were to become jubilant, joyful, and exultant in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should acknowledge what is fact as fact, saying: 'For such and such a reason this is a fact, this is true, there is such a thing in us, this is found among us.'</p>

<h3>II. The Analysis of Virtue</h3>

<h4>1. The Short Section on Virtue (<i>C&#363;&#7735;as&#299;la</i>)</h4>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-7'>7.</a></span> "It is, bhikkhus, only to trifling and insignificant matters, to the minor details of mere moral virtue, that a worldling would refer when speaking in praise of the Tath&#257;gata. And what are those trifling and insignificant matters, those minor details of mere moral virtue, to which he would refer?</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-8'>8.</a></span> "'Having abandoned the destruction of life, the recluse Gotama abstains from the destruction of life. He has laid aside the rod and the sword, and dwells conscientious, full of kindness, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings.' It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the Tath&#257;gata.</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned taking what is not given, the recluse Gotama abstains from taking what is not given. Accepting and expecting only what is given, he dwells in honesty and rectitude of heart.'</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned unchaste living, the recluse Gotama lives the life of chastity. He dwells remote (from women), and abstains from the vulgar practice of sexual intercourse.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-9'>9.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Having abandoned false speech, the recluse Gotama abstains from falsehood. He speaks only the truth, he lives devoted to truth; trustworthy and reliable, he does not deceive anyone in the world.'</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned slander, the recluse Gotama abstains from slander. He does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here in order to divide others from the people here, nor does he repeat here what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these from the people there. Thus he is a reconciler of those who are divided and a promoter of friendships. Rejoicing, delighting, and exulting in concord, he speaks only words that are conducive to concord.'</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned harsh speech, the recluse Gotama abstains from harsh speech. He speaks only such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, endearing, going to the heart, urbane, amiable, and agreeable to many people.'</p>

<p>"Or he might say: 'Having abandoned idle chatter, the recluse Gotama abstains from idle chatter. He speaks at the right time, speaks what is factual, speaks on the good, on the Dhamma and the Discipline. His words are worth treasuring: they are timely, backed by reason, definite and connected with the good.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-10'>10.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'The recluse Gotama abstains from damaging seed and plant life. He eats only in one part of the day, refraining from food at night and from eating at improper times. He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and witnessing unsuitable shows. He abstains from wearing garlands, embellishing himself with scents, and beautifying himself with unguents. He abstains from accepting gold and silver. He abstains from accepting uncooked grain, raw meat, women and girls, male and female slaves, goats and sheep, fowl and swine, elephants, cattle, horses and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and lands. He abstains from running messages and errands. He abstains from buying and selling, and from dealing with false weights, false metals, and false measures. He abstains from the crooked ways of bribery, deception, and fraud. He abstains from mutilating, executing, imprisoning, robbery, plunder, and violence.'</p>

<p>"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that the worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the Tath&#257;gata.</p>

<h4>2. The Intermediate Section on Virtue (<i>Majjhimas&#299;la</i>)</h4>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-11'>11.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some honorable recluses and brahmins, while living on food offered by the faithful, continuously cause damage to seed and plant life &mdash; to plants propagated from roots, stems, joints, buddings, and seeds &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from damaging seed and plant life.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-12'>12.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some honorable recluses and brahmins, while living on food offered by the faithful, enjoy the use of stored up goods such as stored up food, drinks, garments, vehicles, bedding, scents, and comestibles &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from the use of stored up goods'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-13'>13.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some honorable recluses and brahmins, while living on food offered by the faithful, attend unsuitable shows, such as: shows featuring dancing, singing, or instrumental music; theatrical performances; narrations of legends; music played by hand-clapping, cymbals, and drums; picture houses; acrobatic performances; combats of elephants, horses, buffaloes, bulls, goats, rams, cocks and quails; stick-fights, boxing and wrestling, sham-fights, roll-calls, battle-arrays, and regimental reviews &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from attending such unsuitable shows.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-14'>14.</a></span> "Or he might say: "Whereas some honorable recluses and brahmins, while living on food offered by the faithful, indulge in the following games that are a basis for negligence:<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1' title='The explanations of these games are drawn from the commentary.'>[1]</a>  <i>a&#7789;&#7789;hapada</i> (a game played on an eight-row chess-board); <i>dasapada</i> (a game played on a ten-row chess-board); <i>&#257;k&#257;sa</i> (a game of the same type played by imagining a board in the air); <i>parih&#257;rapatha</i> ("hopscotch," a diagram is drawn on the ground and one has to jump in the allowable spaces avoiding the lines); <i>santika</i> ("spellicans," assembling the pieces in a pile, removing and returning them without disturbing the pile); <i>khalika</i> (dice games); <i>gha&#7789;ika</i> (hitting a short stick with a long stick); <i>sal&#257;kahattha</i> (a game played by dipping the hand in paint or dye, striking the ground or a wall, and requiring the participants to show the figure of an elephant, a horse etc.); <i>akkha</i> (ball games); <i>pa&#7749;gac&#299;ra</i> (blowing through toy pipes made of leaves); <i>va&#7749;kaka</i> (ploughing with miniature ploughs); <i>mokkhacika</i> (turning somersaults); <i>ci&#7749;gulika</i> (playing with paper windmills); <i>patt&#257;&#7735;aka</i> (playing with toy measures); <i>rathaka</i> (playing with toy chariots); <i>dhanuka</i> (playing with toy bows); <i>akkharika</i> (guessing at letters written in the air or on one's back); <i>manesika</i> (guessing others' thoughts); <i>yath&#257;vajja</i> (games involving mimicry of deformities) &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from such games and recreations.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-15'>15.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on food offered by the faithful, enjoy the use of high and luxurious beds and seats, such as: spacious couches; thrones with animal figures carved on the supports; long-haired coverlets; multi-colored patchwork coverlets; white woollen coverlets; woollen coverlets embroidered with flowers; quilts stuffed with cotton; woollen coverlets embroidered with animal figures; woollen coverlets with hair on both sides or on one side; bedspreads embroidered with gems; silk coverlets; dance-hall carpets; elephant, horse or chariot rugs; rugs of antelope-skins; choice spreads made of kadali-deer hides; spreads with red awnings overhead; couches with red cushions for the head and feet &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from the use of such high and luxurious beds and seats.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-16'>16.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, enjoy the use of such devices for embellishing and beautifying themselves as the following: rubbing scented powders into the body, massaging with oils, bathing in perfumed water, kneading the limbs, mirrors, ointments, garlands, scents, unguents, face-powders, make-up, bracelets, head-bands, decorated walking sticks, ornamented medicine-tubes, rapiers, sunshades, embroidered sandals, turbans, diadems, yaktail whisks, and long-fringed white robes &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from the use of such devices for embellishment and beautification.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-17'>17.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, engage in frivolous chatter, such as: talk about kings, thieves, and ministers of state; talk about armies, dangers and wars; talk about food, drink, garments, and lodgings; talk about garlands and scents; talk about relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and talk about heroes; street talk and talk by the well; talk about those departed in days gone by; rambling chit-chat; speculations about the world and about the sea; talk about gain and loss &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from such frivolous chatter.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2' title='Tiracchanakatha, often rendered "animal talk"; however, the commentary explains it as "talk which, because it does not lead to emancipation, runs horizontal to the (upward leading) paths to heaven and liberation" (aniyyanikatha saggamokkhamagganam ...'>[2]</a></p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-18'>18.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, engage in wrangling argumentation, (saying to one another): "You don't understand this doctrine and discipline. I am the one who understands this doctrine and discipline." &mdash; "How can you understand this doctrine and discipline?" &mdash; "You're practising the wrong way. I'm practising the right way." &mdash; "I'm being consistent. You're inconsistent." &mdash; "What should have been said first you said last, what should have been said last you said first." &mdash; "What you took so long to think out has been confuted." &mdash; "Your doctrine has been refuted. You're defeated. Go, try to save your doctrine, or disentangle yourself now if you can" &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from such wrangling argumentation.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-19'>19.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, engage in running messages and errands for kings, ministers of state, khattiyas, brahmins, householders, or youths, (who command them): "Go here, go there, take this, bring that from there" &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from running such messages and errands.'</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-20'>20.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, engage in scheming, talking, hinting, belittling others, and pursuing gain with gain &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from such kinds of scheming and talking.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3' title='Improper ways of gaining material support from donors, discussed in detail in Vism 1.61&#8211;82.'>[3]</a></p>

<p>"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a worldling would speak when speaking in praise of the Tath&#257;gata.</p>

<h4>3. The Long Section on Virtue (<i>Mah&#257;s&#299;la</i>)</h4>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='paragraph-21'>21.</a></span> "Or he might say: 'Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as:<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4' title='The explanation of these arts, usually indicated by a single obscure word in the text, is drawn from the commentary.'>[4]</a> prophesying long life, prosperity etc., or the reverse, from the marks on a person's limbs, hands, feet etc; divining by means of omens and signs; making auguries on the basis of thunderbolts and celestial portents; interpreting ominous dreams; telling fortunes from marks on the body; making auguries from the marks on cloth gnawed by mice; offering fire oblations; offering oblations from a ladle; offering oblations of husks, rice powder, rice grains, ghee, and oil to the gods; offering oblations from the mouth; offering blood-sacrifices to the gods; making predictions based on the fingertips; determining whether the site for a proposed house or garden is propitious or not; making predictions for officers of state; the knowledge of charms to lay demons in a cemetery; the knowledge of charms to cure one possessed by ghosts; the knowledge of charms to be pronounced by one living in an earthen house; the snake craft (for curing snake bites and charming snakes); the poison craft (for neutralizing or making poison); the scorpion craft and rat craft (for curing scorpion stings and rat bites, respectively); the bird craft and crow craft (for understanding the cries of birds and crows); foretelling the number of years that a man has to live; the knowledge of charms to give protection from arrows; reciting charms to understand the language of animals &mdash; the recluse Gotama abstains from such wrong means of livelihood, from such debased arts.'</p>

		<dd>The explanations of these games are drawn from the commentary.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-2' id='fn-2'>2</a>.</dt>
		<dd><i>Tiracch&#257;nakath&#257;</i>, often rendered "animal talk"; however, the commentary explains it as "talk which, because it does not lead to emancipation, runs horizontal to the (upward leading) paths to heaven and liberation" (<i>aniyy&#257;nikath&#257;   saggamokkhamagg&#257;na&#7747; tiracch&#257;nabh&#363;t&#257; kath&#257;</i>). An animal, <i>tiracch&#257;nagata</i>, is called so because it moves horizontally with the earth, in contrast to man, who walks erect. But talk that moves horizontally is pointless or frivolous talk, not animal talk. Besides, animals cannot speak.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-3' id='fn-3'>3</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Improper ways of gaining material support from donors, discussed in detail in Vism 1.61&#8211;82.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-4' id='fn-4'>4</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The explanation of these arts, usually indicated by a single obscure word in the text, is drawn from the commentary.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-5' id='fn-5'>5</a>.</dt>

<dt><a href='#fnt-6' id='fn-6'>6</a>.</dt>
		<dd><i>Samva&#7789;&#7789;a-viva&#7789;&#7789;a</i>. These are the two primary divisions of the great aeon (<i>mah&#257;kappa</i>). The <i>samva&#7789;&#7789;akappa</i> is the period between the full evolution of a world system and its complete dissolution, the <i>viva&#7789;&#7789;akappa</i> the period between dissolution and full evolution. The PED definitions should be reversed; see Vism 13.28&#8211;30. Since each period contains a phase of incipient development and a phase of stabilization, the two are further divided to yield four <i>asa&#7749;kheyyakappas</i>, "incalculable aeons," in a great aeon. See A 4:166.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-7' id='fn-7'>7</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The "world of streaming radiance," the sixth of the fifteen planes in the fine-material world (<em>r&#363;paloka</em>), the lowest order to be exempt from the onset of world destruction. The Brahma-world mentioned later is destroyed by the conflagration but reappears at an early stage.</dd>

<h1>Translator's Introduction</h1>
<p>This discourse is one of the masterpieces of the Pali canon. At heart, it is a comprehensive portrait of the Buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes. This portrait is placed in juxtaposition to the Buddhist view of the teachings of rival philosophical teachers of the time, showing how the Buddha &mdash; in contradistinction to the inflexible, party-line approach of his contemporaries &mdash; presented his teaching in a way that was pertinent and sensitive to the needs of his listeners. This larger portrait of the intellectual landscape of early Buddhist India is then presented in a moving narrative frame: the sad story of King Ajatasattu.</p>

<p>Ajatasattu was the son of King Bimbisara of Magadha, one of the Buddha's earliest followers. Urged on by Devadatta &mdash; the Buddha's cousin, who wished to use Ajatasattu's support in his bid to take over the Buddha's position as head of the Sangha &mdash; Ajatasattu arranged for his father's death so that he could secure his own position on the throne. As a result of this evil deed, he was destined not only to be killed by his own son &mdash; <a id="udayibhadda">Udayibhadda</a> (mentioned in the discourse) &mdash; but also to take immediate rebirth in one of the lowest regions of hell.</p>

<p>In this discourse, Ajatasattu visits the Buddha in hopes that the latter will bring some peace to his mind. The question he puts to the Buddha shows the limited level of his own understanding, so the Buddha patiently describes the steps of the training, beginning at a very basic level and gradually moving up, as a way of raising the king's spiritual horizons. At the end of the talk, Ajatasattu takes refuge in the Triple Gem. Although his earlier deeds were so heavy that this expression of faith could have only limited consequences in the immediate present, the Commentary assures us that the king's story would ultimately have a happy ending. After the Buddha's death, he sponsored the First Council, at which a congress of arahant disciples produced the first standardized account of the Buddha's teachings. As a result of the merit coming from this deed, Ajatasattu is destined &mdash; after his release from hell &mdash; to attain Awakening as a Private Buddha.</p>

<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>, in <a id="komarabhacca">Jivaka Komarabhacca</a>'s mango grove, with a large community of monks &mdash; 1,250 monks in all. Now at that time &mdash; it being the observance day, the full-moon night of the water-lily season, the fourth month of the rains &mdash; <a id="ajatasattu">King Ajatasattu</a> of Magadha, the son of <a id="videha">Queen Videha</a>, was sitting on the roof terrace of his palace surrounded by his ministers. Then he felt inspired to exclaim: "How wonderful is this moonlit night! How beautiful... How lovely... How inspiring... How auspicious is this moonlit night! What brahman or contemplative should we visit tonight who might enlighten and bring peace to our mind?"</p>

<p>When this was said, one of the ministers said to the king: "Your majesty, there is <a id="purana1">Purana Kassapa</a>, the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people. He is aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps, if you visited him, he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind."</p>

<p>When this was said, the king remained silent.</p>

<p>Then another minister said to the king: "Your majesty, there is <a id="makkhali1">Makkhali Gosala</a>... Your majesty, there is <a id="ajita1">Ajita Kesakambalin</a>... Your majesty, there is <a id="pakudha1">Pakudha Kaccayana</a>... Your majesty, there is <a id="sanjaya1">Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta</a>... Your majesty, there is <a id="nigantha1">Nigantha Nataputta</a>, the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people. He is aged, long gone forth, advanced in years, in the last phase of life. Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps, if you visited him, he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind."</p>

<p>When this was said, the king remained silent.</p>

<p>All this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king. So the king said to him, "Friend Jivaka, why are you silent?"</p>

<p>"Your majesty, there is the Blessed One, worthy and rightly self-awakened, staying in my mango grove with a large community of monks &mdash; 1,250 monks in all. Concerning this Blessed One, this admirable report has been spread: 'Surely, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of tamable people, teacher of beings human and divine, awakened, blessed.' Your majesty should visit him. Perhaps, if you visited him, he would enlighten and bring peace to your mind."</p>

<p>"Then in that case, friend Jivaka, have the riding elephants prepared."</p>

<p>Having replied, "As you say, your majesty," having had five hundred female elephants prepared as well as the king's personal tusker, Jivaka announced to the king: "Your majesty, your riding elephants are prepared. Do what you think it is now time to do."</p>

<p>Then the king, having had five hundred of his women mounted on the five hundred female elephants &mdash; one on each &mdash; and having mounted his own personal tusker, set out from the capital in full royal state, with attendants carrying torches, headed for Jivaka Komarabhacca's mango grove. But when the king was not far from the mango grove, he was gripped with fear, trepidation, his hair standing on end. Fearful, agitated, his hair standing on end, he said to Jivaka Komarabhacca: "Friend Jivaka, you aren't deceiving me, are you? You aren't betraying me, are you? You aren't turning me over to my enemies, are you? How can there be such a large community of monks &mdash; 1,250 in all &mdash; with no sound of sneezing, no sound of coughing, no voices at all?"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, great king. Don't be afraid. I'm not deceiving you or betraying you or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps burning in the pavilion hall."</p>

<p>Then the king, going as far on his tusker as the ground would permit, dismounted and approached the door of the pavilion on foot. On arrival, he asked Jivaka: "Where, friend Jivaka, is the Blessed One?"</p>

<p>"That is the Blessed One, great king, sitting against the middle pillar, facing east, surrounded by the community of monks."</p>

<p>Then the king approached the Blessed One and, on reaching him, stood to one side. As he was standing there &mdash; surveying the community of monks sitting in absolute silence, as calm as a lake &mdash; he felt inspired to exclaim: "May my son, <a id="udayibhadda2">Prince Udayibhadda</a>, enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoys!"</p>

<p>[The Blessed One said:] "Have you come, great king, together with your affections?"</p>

<p>"Lord, my son, Prince Udayibhadda, is very dear to me. May he enjoy the same peace that this community of monks now enjoys!"</p>

<p>Then, bowing down to the Blessed One, and saluting the community of monks with his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "I would like to ask the Blessed One about a certain issue, if he would give me the opportunity to explain my question."</p>

<p>"Ask, great king, whatever you like."</p>

<h4>The King's Question</h4>
<p>"Lord, there are these common craftsmen: elephant-trainers, horse-trainers, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshals, supply corps officers, high royal officers, commandos, military heroes, armor-clad warriors, leather-clad warriors, domestic slaves, confectioners, barbers, bath attendants, cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, calculators, accountants, and any other common craftsmen of a similar sort. They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now. They give pleasure and refreshment to themselves, to their parents, wives, and children, to their friends and colleagues. They put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives, leading to heaven, resulting in happiness, conducive to a heavenly rebirth. Is it possible, lord, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember, great king, ever having asked this question of other brahmans and contemplatives?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do."</p>

<p>"If it isn't troublesome for you, how did they answer?"</p>

<p>"No, it's not troublesome for me wherever the Blessed One &mdash; or someone like the Blessed One &mdash; is sitting."</p>

<p>"Then speak, great king."</p>

<h4>Non-action</h4>
<p>"Once, lord, I approached <a id="purana2">Purana Kassapa</a> and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Kassapa, there are these common craftsmen... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?'</p>

<p>"When this was said, Purana Kassapa said to me, 'Great king, in acting or getting others to act, in mutilating or getting others to mutilate, in torturing or getting others to torture, in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow, in tormenting or getting others to torment, in intimidating or getting others to intimidate, in taking life, taking what is not given, breaking into houses, plundering wealth, committing burglary, ambushing highways, committing adultery, speaking falsehood &mdash; one does no evil. If with a razor-edged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh, a single pile of flesh, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges, killing and getting others to kill, mutilating and getting others to mutilate, torturing and getting others to torture, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges, giving and getting others to give, making sacrifices and getting others to make sacrifices, there would be no merit from that cause, no coming of merit. Through generosity, self-control, restraint, and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause, no coming of merit.'</p>

<p>"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Purana Kassapa answered with non-action. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Purana Kassapa answered with non-action. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Purana Kassapa's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>Purification through Wandering-on</h4>
<p>"Another time I approached <a id="makkhali2">Makkhali Gosala</a> and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Gosala, there are these common craftsmen... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?'</p>

<p>"When this was said, Makkhali Gosala said to me, 'Great king, there is no cause, no requisite condition, for the defilement of beings. Beings are defiled without cause, without requisite condition. There is no cause, no requisite condition, for the purification of beings. Beings are purified without cause, without requisite condition. There is nothing self-caused, nothing other-caused, nothing human-caused. There is no strength, no effort, no human energy, no human endeavor. All living beings, all life, all beings, all souls are powerless, devoid of strength, devoid of effort. Subject to the changes of fate, serendipity, and nature, they are sensitive to pleasure and pain in the six great classes of birth.</p>

<p>"'There are 1,406,600 principle modes of origin. There are 500 kinds of kamma, five kinds, and three kinds; full kamma and half kamma. There are 62 pathways, 62 sub-eons, six great classes of birth, eight classes of men, 4,900 modes of livelihood, 4,900 kinds of wanderers, 4,900 Naga-abodes, 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, 36 dust-realms, seven spheres of percipient beings, seven spheres of non-percipient beings, seven kinds of jointed plants, seven kinds of devas, seven kinds of human beings, seven kinds of demons, seven great lakes, seven major knots, seven minor knots, 700 major precipices, 700 minor precipices, 700 major dreams, 700 minor dreams, 84,000 great aeons. Having transmigrated and wandered on through these, the wise and the foolish alike will put an end to pain.</p>

<p>"'Though one might think, "Through this morality, this practice, this austerity, or this holy life I will ripen unripened kamma and eliminate ripened kamma whenever touched by it" &mdash; that is impossible. Pleasure and pain are measured out, the wandering-on is fixed in its limits. There is no shortening or lengthening, no accelerating or decelerating. <a id="string">Just as a ball</a> of string, when thrown, comes to its end simply by unwinding, in the same way, having transmigrated and wandered on, the wise and the foolish alike will put an end to pain.'</p>

<p>"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Makkhali Gosala answered with purification through wandering-on. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango. In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Makkhali Gosala answered with purification through wandering-on. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Makkhali Gosala's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>Annihilation</h4>
<p>"Another time I approached <a id="ajita2">Ajita Kesakambalin</a> and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Ajita, there are these common craftsmen... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?'</p>

<p>"When this was said, Ajita Kesakambalin said to me, 'Great king, there is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no brahmans or contemplatives who, faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves. A person is a composite of four primary elements. At death, the earth (in the body) returns to and merges with the (external) earth-substance. The fire returns to and merges with the external fire-substance. The liquid returns to and merges with the external liquid-substance. The wind returns to and merges with the external wind-substance. The sense-faculties scatter into space. Four men, with the bier as the fifth, carry the corpse. Its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground. The bones turn pigeon-colored. The offerings end in ashes. Generosity is taught by idiots. The words of those who speak of existence after death are false, empty chatter. With the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after death.'</p>

<p>"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Ajita Kesakambalin answered with annihilation. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango. In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Ajita Kesakambalin answered with annihilation. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Ajita Kesakambalin's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>Non-relatedness</h4>
<p>"Another time I approached <a id="pakudha2">Pakudha Kaccayana</a> and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Kaccayana, there are these common craftsmen... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?'</p>

<p>"When this was said, Pakudha Kaccayana said to me, 'Great king, there are these seven substances &mdash; unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar &mdash; that do not alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, are incapable of causing one another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain. Which seven? The earth-substance, the liquid-substance, the fire-substance, the wind-substance, pleasure, pain, and the soul as the seventh. These are the seven substances &mdash; unmade, irreducible, uncreated, without a creator, barren, stable as a mountain-peak, standing firm like a pillar &mdash; that do not alter, do not change, do not interfere with one another, and are incapable of causing one another pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain.</p>

<p>"'And among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing, no hearer nor one who causes hearing, no cognizer nor one who causes cognition. When one cuts off [another person's] head, there is no one taking anyone's life. It is simply between the seven substances that the sword passes.'</p>

<p>"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Pakudha Kaccayana answered with non-relatedness. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango. In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Pakudha Kaccayana answered with non-relatedness. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Pakudha Kaccayana's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>Fourfold Restraint</h4>
<p>"Another time I approached <a id="nigantha2">Nigantha Nataputta</a> and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Aggivessana, there are these common craftsmen... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?'</p>

<p>"When this was said, Nigantha Nataputta said to me, 'Great king, there is the case where the Nigantha &mdash; the knotless one &mdash; is restrained with the fourfold restraint. And how is the Nigantha restrained with the fourfold restraint? There is the case where the Nigantha is obstructed by all waters, conjoined with all waters, cleansed with all waters, suffused with all waters. This is how the Nigantha is restrained with the fourfold restraint. When the Nigantha &mdash; a knotless one &mdash; is restrained with such a fourfold restraint, he is said to be a Knotless One (Nigantha), a son of <a id="nata">Nata</a> (Nataputta), with his self perfected, his self controlled, his self established.'</p>

<p>"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Nigantha Nataputta answered with fourfold restraint. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Nigantha Nataputta answered with fourfold restraint. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Nigantha Nataputta's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>Evasion</h4>
<p>"Another time I approached <a id="sanjaya2">Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta</a> and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, I sat to one side. As I was sitting there I asked him: 'Venerable Sa&ntilde;jaya, there are these common craftsmen... They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now... Is it possible, venerable sir, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?'</p>

<p>"When this was said, Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta said to me, 'If you ask me if there exists another world [after death], if I thought that there exists another world, would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not. If you asked me if there isn't another world... both is and isn't... neither is nor isn't... if there are beings who transmigrate... if there aren't... both are and aren't... neither are nor aren't... if the Tathagata exists after death... doesn't... both... neither exists nor doesn't exist after death, would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not.'</p>

<p>"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion. The thought occurred to me: 'This &mdash; among these brahmans and contemplatives &mdash; is the most foolish and confused of all. How can he, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, answer with evasion?' Still the thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a brahman or contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I neither delighted in Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left.</p>

<h4>The First Visible Fruit of the Contemplative Life</h4>
<p>"So, lord, I ask the Blessed One as well: There are these common craftsmen: elephant-trainers, horse-trainers, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshals, supply corps officers, high royal officers, commandos, military heroes, armor-clad warriors, leather-clad warriors, domestic slaves, confectioners, barbers, bath attendants, cooks, garland-makers, laundrymen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, calculators, accountants, and any other common craftsmen of a similar sort. They live off the fruits of their crafts, visible in the here and now. They give pleasure and refreshment to themselves, to their parents, wives, and children, to their friends and colleagues. They put in place an excellent presentation of offerings to brahmans and contemplatives, leading to heaven, resulting in happiness, conducive to a heavenly rebirth. Is it possible, lord, to point out a similar fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, great king. But first, with regard to that, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer however you please. Suppose there were a man of yours: your slave, your workman, rising in the morning before you, going to bed in the evening only after you, doing whatever you order, always acting to please you, speaking politely to you, always watching for the look on your face. The thought would occur to him: 'Isn't it amazing? Isn't it astounding? &mdash; the destination, the results, of meritorious deeds. For this King Ajatasattu is a human being, and I, too, am a human being, yet King Ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the five strings of sensuality &mdash; like a deva, as it were &mdash; while I am his slave, his workman... always watching for the look on his face. I, too, should do meritorious deeds. What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'</p>

<p>"So after some time he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. Having thus gone forth he lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude. Then suppose one of your men were to inform you: 'You should know, your majesty, that that man of yours &mdash; your slave, your workman... always watching for the look on your face... has gone forth from the household life into homelessness... content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.' Would you, thus informed, say, 'Bring that man back to me. Make him again be my slave, my workman... always watching for the look on my face!'?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, lord. Rather, I am the one who should bow down to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, invite him to accept gifts of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. And I would provide him with righteous safety, defense, and protection."</p>

<p>"So what do you think, great king. With that being the case, is there a visible fruit of the contemplative life, or is there not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lord. With that being the case, there certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life."</p>

<p>"This, great king, is the first fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now, that I point out to you."</p>

<h4>The Second Visible Fruit of the Contemplative Life</h4>
<p>"But is it possible, lord, to point out yet another fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, great king. But first, with regard to that, I will ask you a counter-question. Answer however you please. Suppose there were a man of yours: a farmer, a householder, a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury. The thought would occur to him: 'Isn't it amazing? Isn't it astounding? &mdash; the destination, the results, of meritorious deeds! For this King Ajatasattu is a human being, and I, too, am a human being, yet King Ajatasattu enjoys himself supplied and replete with the five strings of sensuality &mdash; like a deva, as it were &mdash; while I am a farmer, a householder, a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury. I, too, should do meritorious deeds. What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'</p>

<p>"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness. Having thus gone forth he lives restrained in body, speech, and mind, content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude. Then suppose one of your men were to inform you: 'You should know, your majesty, that that man of yours &mdash; the farmer, the householder, the taxpayer swelling the royal treasury... has gone forth from the household life into homelessness... content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude.' Would you, thus informed, say, 'Bring that man back to me. Make him again be a farmer, a householder, a taxpayer swelling the royal treasury!'?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, lord. Rather, I am the one who should bow down to him, rise up out of respect for him, invite him to a seat, invite him to accept gifts of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. And I would provide him with righteous safety, defense, and protection."</p>

<p>"So what do you think, great king. With that being the case, is there a visible fruit of the contemplative life, or is there not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lord. With that being the case, there certainly is a visible fruit of the contemplative life."</p>

<p>"This, great king, is the second fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now, that I point out to you."</p>

<h4>Higher Fruits of the Contemplative Life</h4>
<p>"But is it possible, lord, to point out yet another fruit of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, great king. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak.</p>

<p>"There is the case, great king, where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure.</p>

<p>"A householder or householder's son, hearing the Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: '<a id="dusty">Household life is confining</a>, a dusty path. The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, <a id="shell">like a polished shell</a>. What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'</p>

<p>"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>

<p>"When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Consummate in his virtue, he guards the doors of his senses, is possessed of mindfulness and alertness, and is content.</p>

<h4><a id="virtue">The Lesser Section on Virtue</a></h4>
<p>"And how is a monk consummate in virtue? Abandoning the taking of life, he abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. This is part of his virtue.</p>

<p>"Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what is given, accepts only what is given, lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>

<p>"Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life, aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>

<p>"Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>

<p>"Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>

<p>"Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>

<p>"Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, and the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>

<p>"He abstains from damaging seed and plant life.</p>

<p>"He eats only once a day, refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of day.</p>

<p>"He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and from watching shows.</p>

<p>"He abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics.</p>

<p>"He abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats.</p>

<p>"He abstains from accepting gold and money.</p>

<p>"A monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue. <a id="king">Just as</a> a head-anointed noble warrior king who has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies, in the same way the monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue. Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless. This is how a monk is consummate in virtue.</p>

<h4>Sense Restraint</h4>
<p>"And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses? On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which &mdash; if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye &mdash; evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear... On smelling an odor with the nose... On tasting a flavor with the tongue... On touching a tactile sensation with the body... On cognizing an idea with the intellect, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which &mdash; if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect &mdash; evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless. This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses.</p>

<h4>Mindfulness &amp; Alertness</h4>
<p>"And how is a monk possessed of mindfulness and alertness? When going forward and returning, he acts with alertness. When looking toward and looking away... when bending and extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe, and his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting... when urinating and defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and remaining silent, he acts with alertness. This is how a monk is possessed of mindfulness and alertness.</p>

<h4>Contentedness</h4>
<p>"And how is a monk content? <a id="bird">Just as a bird</a>, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden; so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and almsfood to provide for his hunger. Wherever he goes, he takes only his barest necessities along. This is how a monk is content.</p>

<h4>Abandoning the Hindrances</h4>
<p>"Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and alertness, and this noble contentment, he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a forest, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore.</p>

<p>"Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger. Abandoning sloth and drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness and anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty.</p>

<p>"<a id="loan">Suppose that a man</a>, taking a loan, invests it in his business affairs. His business affairs succeed. He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, taking a loan, I invested it in my business affairs. Now my business affairs have succeeded. I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>

<p>"<a id="sick">Now suppose that a man</a> falls sick &mdash; in pain and seriously ill. He does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time passes, he eventually recovers from that sickness. He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was sick... Now I am recovered from that sickness. I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>

<p>"<a id="prison">Now suppose that a man</a> is bound in prison. As time passes, he eventually is released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was bound in prison. Now I am released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>

<p>"<a id="slave">Now suppose that a man</a> is a slave, subject to others, not subject to himself, unable to go where he likes. As time passes, he eventually is released from that slavery, subject to himself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where he likes. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was a slave... Now I am released from that slavery, subject to myself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where I like.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>

<p>"<a id="safe">Now suppose that a man</a>, carrying money and goods, is traveling by a road through desolate country. As time passes, he eventually emerges from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, carrying money and goods, I was traveling by a road through desolate country. Now I have emerged from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>

<p>"In the same way, when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security. Seeing that they have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>
<h4>(<a id="jhanas">The Four Jhanas</a>)</h4>
<p>"Quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal. <a id="bathman">Just as if a skilled bathman</a> or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again and again with water, so that his ball of bath powder &mdash; saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within and without &mdash; would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal.</p>

<p>"This is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<p>"Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure. <a id="lake">Just like a lake</a> with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade, suffuse and fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure.</p>

<p>"This, too, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<p>"And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. <a id="pond">Just as in a lotus pond</a>, some of the lotuses, born and growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated and pervaded, suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture.</p>

<p>"This, too, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<p>"And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and stress &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress &mdash; he enters and remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure nor stress. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. <a id="cloth">Just as if a man</a> were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness.</p>

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<h4>Insight Knowledge</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' <a id="gem">Just as if there were</a> a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water &mdash; eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread &mdash; and a man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects. And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.'</p>

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<h4>The Mind-made Body</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. <a id="reed">Just as if a man</a> were to draw a reed from its sheath. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' <a id="sword">Or as if a man</a> were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' <a id="snake">Or as if a man</a> were to pull a snake out from its slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties.</p>

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<h4>Supranormal Powers</h4>
<p>"<a id="supranormal">With his mind</a> thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. <a id="potter">Just as a skilled potter</a> or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes, <a id="carver">or as a skilled ivory-carver</a> or his assistant could craft from well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, <a id="gold">or as a skilled goldsmith</a> or his assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers... He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<h4><a id="clairaudience">Clairaudience</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears &mdash; by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. <a id="drums">Just as if a man</a> traveling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, and tom-toms. He would know, 'That is the sound of kettledrums, that is the sound of small drums, that is the sound of conchs, that is the sound of cymbals, and that is the sound of tom-toms.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears &mdash; by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far.</p>

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<h4><a id="mindreading">Mind Reading</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion. He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind. <a id="reflection">Just as if a young woman</a> &mdash; or man &mdash; fond of ornaments, examining the reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know 'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not. In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness.

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<h4><a id="recollection">Recollection of Past Lives</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details. <a id="village">Just as if a man</a> were to go from his home village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives... in their modes and details.</p>

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<h4><a id="beings">The Passing Away &amp; Re-appearance of Beings</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings &mdash; who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings &mdash; who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma. <a id="building">Just as if there were a tall building</a> in the central square [of a town], and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house, leaving it, walking along the street, and sitting in the central square. The thought would occur to him, 'These people are entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and sitting in the central square.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma...</p>

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime.</p>

<h4><a id="asava">The Ending of Mental Fermentations</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' <a id="pool">Just as if there were</a> a pool of water in a mountain glen &mdash; clear, limpid, and unsullied &mdash; where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, and unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

<p>"This, too, great king, is a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, more excellent than the previous ones and more sublime. And as for another visible fruit of the contemplative life, higher and more sublime than this, there is none."</p>

<p>When this was said, King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed One: "<a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One &mdash; through many lines of reasoning &mdash; made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life.</p>

<p>"A transgression has overcome me, lord, in that I was so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill my father &mdash; a righteous man, a righteous king &mdash; for the sake of sovereign rulership. May the Blessed One please accept this confession of my transgression as such, so that I may restrain myself in the future."</p>

<p>"Yes, great king, a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill your father &mdash; a righteous man, a righteous king &mdash; for the sake of sovereign rulership. But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept your confession. For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma &amp; Discipline of the noble ones when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future."</p>

<p>When this was said, King Ajatasattu said to the Blessed One: "Well, then, lord, I am now taking leave. Many are my duties, many my responsibilities."</p>

<p>"Then do, great king, what you think it is now time to do."</p>

<p><a id="eye"></a>So King Ajatasattu, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, bowed down to him, and &mdash; after circumambulating him &mdash; left. Not long after King Ajatasattu had left, the Blessed One addressed the monks: "The king is wounded, monks. The king is incapacitated. Had he not killed his father &mdash; that righteous man, that righteous king &mdash; the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye would have arisen to him as he sat in this very seat."</p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

<h1>Translator's Introduction</h1>
<p>This sutta portrays two modes by which the Buddha responded to the controversial issues of his day. The first mode &mdash; illustrated by his contribution to the discussion on the ultimate cessation of perception &mdash; was to adopt the terms of the discussion but to invest them with his own meanings, and then to try to direct the discussion to the practice leading to the cessation of suffering &amp; stress. The second mode &mdash; illustrated by his treatment of whether the cosmos is eternal, etc. &mdash; was to declare the issues as unconducive to awakening, and to refuse to take a position on them.</p>
<p>Several other suttas &mdash; such as <a href="../mn/mn.063.than.html">MN 63</a>, <a href="../mn/mn.072.than.html">MN 72</a>, and <a href="../an/an10/an10.093.than.html">AN 10.93</a> &mdash; portray the Buddha and his disciples adopting the second mode. This sutta is unusual in its extended portrait of the Buddha's adopting the first. Many of the technical terms he uses here &mdash; such as the perception of a refined truth, the peak of perception, the alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception, the acquisition of a self &mdash; are found no where else in the Canon. At the end of the sutta, he describes them as "the world's designations, the world's expressions, the world's ways of speaking, the world's descriptions, with which the Tathagata expresses himself but without grasping at them." In other words, he picks them up for the purpose at hand and then lets them go. Thus they are not to be regarded as central to his teaching. Instead, they should be read as examples of his ability to adapt the language of his interlocutors to his own purposes. For this reason, this sutta is best read only after you have read other suttas and are familiar with the more central concepts of the Buddha's teachings.</p>
<p>Of particular interest here is the Buddha's treatment of the three "acquisitions of a self." The first &mdash; the gross self &mdash; refers to the ordinary, everyday sense of identifying with one's body. The latter two &mdash; the mind-made acquisition and the formless acquisition &mdash; refer to the sense of self that can be developed in meditation. The mind-made acquisition can result from an experience of the mind-made body &mdash; the "astral body" &mdash; that constitutes one of the powers that can be developed through concentration practice. The formless acquisition can result from any of the formless states of concentration &mdash; such as an experience of infinite space, infinite consciousness, or nothingness. Although meditators, on experiencing these states, might assume that they have encountered their "true self," the Buddha is careful to note that these are acquisitions, and that they are no more one's true self than the body is. They are one's acquisition of a self only for the time that one identifies with them. The Buddha goes on to say that he teaches the Dhamma for the sake of abandoning every acquisition of a self "such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter &amp; remain in the culmination &amp; abundance of discernment, having known &amp; realized it for yourself in the here &amp; now."</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="savatthi">Savatthi</a> in Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha">Anathapindika's monastery</a>. Now on that occasion <a id="potthapada">Potthapada the wanderer</a>, together with a large following of about 300 wanderers, had taken up residence in the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the single-pavilion park of <a id="mallika">Queen Mallika</a>. Then the Blessed One, early in the morning, taking his robes &amp; bowl, entered Savatthi for alms. Then the thought occurred to him, "While it's still too early to go into Savatthi for alms, why don't I go to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the single-pavilion park of Queen Mallika to see Potthapada the wanderer?" So he went to the debating hall near the Tinduka tree in the single-pavilion park of Queen Mallika.</p>
<p>Now on that occasion Potthapada the wanderer was sitting with his large following of wanderers, all making a great noise &amp; racket, discussing many kinds of bestial topics of conversation: conversation about kings, robbers, &amp; ministers of state; armies, alarms, &amp; battles; food &amp; drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, &amp; scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women &amp; heroes; the gossip of the street &amp; the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity, the creation of the world &amp; of the sea; talk of whether things exist or not. Then Potthapada the wanderer saw the Blessed One coming from afar, and on seeing him, hushed his following: "Be quiet, good sirs. Don't make any noise. Here comes Gotama the contemplative. He is fond of quietude and speaks in praise of quietude. Maybe, if he perceives our group as quiet, he will consider it worth his while to come our way." So the wanderers fell silent.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One went to Potthapada, and Potthapada said to him, "Come, Blessed One. Welcome, Blessed One. It's been a long time since the Blessed One has gone out of his way to come here. Sit down, Blessed One. This seat has been prepared." So the Blessed One sat on the prepared seat. Potthapada, taking a lower seat, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "For what topic of conversation are you gathered together here? In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted?"</p>
<p>When this was said, Potthapada replied, "Never mind, lord, about the topic of conversation for which we have gathered here. It won't be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that later. For the past few days a discussion has arisen among the many sects of brahmans &amp; contemplatives gathered and sitting together in the debating hall, concerning the ultimate cessation of perception: 'How is there the ultimate cessation of perception?' With regard to this, some said, 'A person's perception arises and ceases without cause, without reason. When it arises, one is percipient. When it ceases, one is not percipient.' <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> That's how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception.</p>
<p>"Then someone else said, 'No, that's not how it is. Perception is a person's self, which comes and goes. When it comes, one is percipient. When it goes, one is not percipient.' That's how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception.</p>
<p>"Then someone else said, 'No, that's not how it is, for there are brahmans &amp; contemplatives of great power, great potency. They draw perception in and out of a person. When they draw it in, one is percipient. When they draw it out, one is not percipient.' That's how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception.</p>
<p>"Then someone else said, 'No, that's not how it is, for there are devas of great power, great potency. They draw perception in and out of a person. When they draw it in, one is percipient. When they draw it out, one is not percipient.' That's how one group described the ultimate cessation of perception.</p>
<p>"Then the memory of the Blessed One arose within me: 'Ah, the Blessed One! Ah, the One Well-gone &mdash; who surely is well-skilled in these matters.' The Blessed One is skilled and expert in the ultimate cessation of perception. So what, lord, is the ultimate cessation of perception?"</p>
<p>"In this regard, Potthapada, those brahmans &amp; contemplatives who say that a person's perception arises &amp; ceases without cause, without reason, are wrong from the very start. Why is that? Because a person's perception arises &amp; ceases with a cause, with a reason. With training, one perception arises and with training another perception ceases. And what is that training?</p>
<p>"There is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. [as in <a href="dn.02.0.than.html">DN 2</a>] ...</p>
<p>"This is how a monk is consummate in virtue...</p>
<p>"Seeing that these five hindrances have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>
<p>"Quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities, the monk enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. His earlier perception of sensuality ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion. And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.</p>
<p>"Then, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, the monk enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration. And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.</p>
<p>"And then, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' His earlier perception of a refined truth of rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of equanimity. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of equanimity. And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.</p>
<p>"And then, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress &mdash; the monk enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. His earlier perception of a refined truth of equanimity ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain. And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.</p>
<p>"And then, with the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, [perceiving,] 'Infinite space,' the monk enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. His earlier perception of a refined truth of neither pleasure nor pain ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space. And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.</p>
<p>"And then, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, [perceiving,] 'Infinite consciousness,' the monk enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of space ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases.</p>
<p>"And then, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, [thinking,] 'There is nothing,' enters &amp; remains in the dimension of nothingness. His earlier perception of a refined truth of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness ceases, and on that occasion there is a perception of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness. On that occasion he is one who is percipient of a refined truth of the dimension of nothingness. And thus it is that with training one perception arises and with training another perception ceases. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a></p>
<p>"Now, when the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception. As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, 'Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me. If I were to think and will, this perception of mine would cease, and a grosser perception would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?' <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> So he neither thinks nor wills, and as he is neither thinking nor willing, that perception ceases <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4'>[4]</a> and another, grosser perception does not appear. He touches cessation. This, Potthapada, is how there is the alert <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5'>[5]</a> step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception.</p>
<p>"Now what do you think, Potthapada &mdash; have you ever before heard of such an alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception?"</p>
<p>"No, lord. And here is how I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: 'When the monk is percipient of himself here, then from there to there, step by step, he touches the peak of perception. As he remains at the peak of perception, the thought occurs to him, "Thinking is bad for me. Not thinking is better for me. If I were to think and will, this perception of mine would cease, and a grosser perception would appear. What if I were neither to think nor to will?" So he neither thinks nor wills, and as he is neither thinking nor willing, that perception ceases and another, grosser perception does not appear. He touches cessation. This, Potthapada, is how there is the alert step-by step attainment of the ultimate cessation of perception.'"</p>
<p>"That's right, Potthapada."</p>
<p>"But, lord, does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception or many peaks of perception?"</p>
<p>"Potthapada, I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception."</p>
<p>"And how does the Blessed One describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception?"</p>
<p>"In whatever way one touches cessation, Potthapada, that's the way I describe the peak of perception. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-6' id='fnt-6'>[6]</a> That's how I describe one peak of perception and many peaks of perception."</p>
<p>"Now, lord, does perception arise first, and knowledge after; or does knowledge arise first, and perception after; or do perception &amp; knowledge arise simultaneously?"</p>
<p>"Potthapada, perception arises first, and knowledge after. And the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception. One discerns, 'It's in dependence on this <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-7' id='fnt-7'>[7]</a> that my knowledge has arisen.' Through this line of reasoning one can realize how perception arises first, and knowledge after, and how the arising of knowledge comes from the arising of perception."</p>
<p>"Now, lord, is perception a person's self, or is perception one thing and self another?"</p>
<p>"What self do you posit, Potthapada?"</p>
<p><a id="dhatu4"></a>"I posit a gross self, possessed of form, made up of the four great existents [earth, water, fire, and wind], feeding on physical food."</p>
<p>"Then, Potthapada, your self would be gross, possessed of form, made up of the four great existents, feeding on physical food. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another. And it's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another: even as there remains this gross self &mdash; possessed of form, made up of the four great existents, and feeding on food &mdash; one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away. It's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another."</p>
<p>"Then, lord, I posit a mind-made self complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties." <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8' id='fnt-8'>[8]</a></p>
<p>"Then, Potthapada, your self would be mind-made, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another. And it's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another: even as there remains this mind-made self &mdash; complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties &mdash; one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away. It's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another."</p>
<p>"Then, lord, I posit a formless self made of perception."</p>
<p>"Then, Potthapada, your self would be formless and made of perception. That being the case, then for you perception would be one thing and self another. And it's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another: even as there remains this formless self made of perception, one perception arises for that person as another perception passes away. It's through this line of reasoning that one can realize how perception will be one thing and self another."</p>
<p>"Is it possible for me to know, lord, whether perception is a person's self or if perception is one thing and self another?"</p>
<p>"Potthapada &mdash; having other views, other practices, other satisfactions, other aims, other teachers &mdash; it's hard for you to know whether perception is a person's self or if perception is one thing and self another."</p>
<p>"<a id="questions">Well then</a>, lord, if &mdash; having other views, other practices, other satisfactions, other aims, other teachers &mdash; it's hard for me to know whether perception is a person's self or if perception is one thing and self another, then is it the case that the cosmos is eternal, that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless?"</p>
<p>"Potthapada, I haven't expounded that the cosmos is eternal, that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless."</p>
<p>"Then is it the case that the cosmos is not eternal, that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless?"</p>
<p>"Potthapada, I haven't expounded that the cosmos is not eternal, that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless."</p>
<p>"Then is it the case that the cosmos is finite... the cosmos is infinite... the soul &amp; the body are the same... the soul is one thing and the body another... after death a Tathagata exists... after death a Tathagata does not exist... after death a Tathagata both exists &amp; does not exist... after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist, that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless?"</p>
<p>"Potthapada, I haven't expounded that after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist, that only this is true and anything otherwise is worthless."</p>
<p>"But why hasn't the Blessed One expounded these things?"</p>
<p>"Because they are not conducive to the goal, are not conducive to the Dhamma, are not basic to the holy life. They don't lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That's why I haven't expounded them."</p>
<p>"And what <i>has</i> the Blessed One expounded?"</p>
<p>"I have expounded that, 'This is stress'... 'This is the origination of stress'... 'This is the cessation of stress'... 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'</p>
<p>"And why has the Blessed One expounded these things?"</p>
<p>"Because they are conducive to the goal, conducive to the Dhamma, and basic to the holy life. They lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That's why I have expounded them."</p>
<p>"So it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Well now, it's time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit."</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One got up from his seat and left.</p>
<p>Not long after he had left, the wanderers, with sneering words, jeered at Potthapada the wanderer from all sides: "So, whatever Gotama the contemplative says, Sir Potthapada rejoices in his every word: 'So it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone.' But <i>we</i> don't understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or... whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist."</p>
<p>When this was said, Potthapada the wanderer replied to the wanderers, "I, too, don't understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or... whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist. But Gotama the contemplative describes a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma. And when a genuine, authentic, and accurate practice, grounded in the Dhamma and consonant with the Dhamma is being explained, why shouldn't a knowledgeable person such as myself rejoice in the well-spokenness of Gotama the contemplative's well-spoken words?"</p>
<p>Then two or three days later, <a id="citta">Citta the elephant trainer's son</a> and Potthapada the wanderer went to the Blessed One. On their arrival, Citta bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to one side, while Potthapada the wanderer greeted the Blessed One courteously. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "The other day, not long after the Blessed One had left, the wanderers, with sneering words, jeered at me from all sides: 'So, whatever Gotama the contemplative says, Sir Potthapada rejoices in his every word: "So it is, Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone." But <i>we</i> don't understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or... whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist.'</p>
<p>"When this was said, I replied to the wanderers, 'I, too, don't understand Gotama the contemplative as having taught any categorical teaching as to whether the cosmos is infinite or the cosmos is finite or... whether after death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist.

<p>[The Buddha:] "Potthapada, all those wanderers are blind and have no eyes. You alone among them have eyes. I have taught and declared some teachings to be categorical, and some teachings to be non-categorical. And what are the teachings that I have taught and declared to be non-categorical? [The statement that] 'The cosmos is eternal' I have taught and declared to be an non-categorical teaching. [The statement that] 'The cosmos is not eternal'... 'The cosmos is finite'... 'The cosmos is infinite'... 'The soul &amp; the body are the same'... 'The soul is one thing and the body another'... 'After death a Tathagata exists'... 'After death a Tathagata does not exist'... 'After death a Tathagata both exists &amp; does not exist'... 'After death a Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist' I have taught and declared to be an non-categorical teaching. And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be non-categorical? Because they are not conducive to the goal, are not conducive to the Dhamma, are not basic to the holy life. They don't lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That's why I have taught and declared them to be non-categorical.</p>
<p>"And what have I taught and declared to be categorical teachings? [The statement that] 'This is stress' I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching. [The statement that] 'This is the origination of stress'... 'This is the cessation of stress'... 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress' I have taught and declared to be a categorical teaching. And why have I taught and declared these teachings to be categorical? Because they are conducive to the goal, conducive to the Dhamma, and basic to the holy life. They lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. That's why I have taught and declared them to be categorical.</p>
<p>"There are some brahmans &amp; contemplatives with a doctrine &amp; view like this: 'After death, the self is exclusively happy and free from disease.' I approached them and asked them, 'Is it true that you have a doctrine &amp; view like this: "After death, the self is exclusively happy and free from disease"?' When asked this, they replied, 'Yes.' So I asked them, 'But do you dwell having known or seen an exclusively happy world?' When asked this, they said, 'No.' So I asked them, 'But have you ever been aware of a self exclusively happy for a day or a night, or for half a day or half a night?' When asked this, they said, 'No.' So I asked them, 'But do you know that "This is the path, this is the practice for the realization of an exclusively happy world"?' When asked this, they said, 'No.' So I asked them, 'But have you heard the voices of devas reborn in an exclusively happy world, saying, "Practice well, my dears. Practice straightforwardly, my dears, for the realization of an exclusively happy world, because it was through such a practice that we ourselves have been reborn in an exclusively happy world"?' When asked this, they said, 'No.'</p>
<p>"So what do you think, Potthapada &mdash; when this is the case, don't the words of those brahmans &amp; contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord. When this is the case, the words of those brahmans &amp; contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing."</p>
<p>"Potthapada, it's as if a man were to say, 'I'm in love with the most beautiful woman in this country,' and other people were to say to him, 'Well, my good man, this most beautiful woman in this country with whom you are in love: do you know if she's of the warrior caste, the priestly caste, the merchant caste, or the laborer caste?' and, when asked this, he would say, 'No.' Then they would say to him, 'Well then, do you know her name or clan name? Whether she's tall, short, or of medium height? Whether she's dark, fair, or ruddy-skinned? Do you know what village or town or city she's from?' When asked this, he would say, 'No.' Then they would say to him, 'So you've never known or seen the woman you're in love with?' When asked this, he would say, 'Yes.'</p>
<p>"So what do you think, Potthapada &mdash; when this is the case, don't the words of that man turn out to be unconvincing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord..."</p>
<p>"In the same way, there are some brahmans &amp; contemplatives with a doctrine &amp; view like this: 'After death, the self is exclusively happy and free from disease.'... Don't the words of those brahmans &amp; contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord..."</p>
<p>"<a id="staircase">Potthapada</a>, it's as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace, and other people were to say to him, 'Well, my good man, this palace for which you are building a staircase: do you know whether it's east, west, north, or south of here? Whether it's high, low, or in between?' and, when asked this, he would say, 'No.' Then they would say to him, 'So you don't know or see the palace for which you are building a staircase?' When asked this, he would say, 'Yes.'</p>

<p>"Yes, lord. When this is the case, the words of those brahmans &amp; contemplatives turn out to be unconvincing."</p>
<p>"Potthapada, there are these <a id="acquisitions3">three acquisitions of a self</a>: the gross acquisition of a self, the mind-made acquisition of a self, and the formless acquisition of a self. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9' id='fnt-9'>[9]</a> And what is the gross acquisition of a self? Possessed of form, made up of the four great existents, feeding on physical food: this is the gross acquisition of a self. And what is the mind-made acquisition of a self? Possessed of form, mind-made, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties: this is the mind-made acquisition of a self. And what is the formless acquisition of a self? Formless and made of perception: this is the formless acquisition of a self.</p>
<p>"I teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the gross acquisition of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter &amp; remain in the culmination &amp; abundance of discernment, having known &amp; realized it for yourself in the here &amp; now. If the thought should occur to you that, when defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters &amp; remains in the culmination &amp; abundance of discernment, having known &amp; realized it for oneself in the here &amp; now, one's abiding is stressful/painful, you should not see it in that way. When defiling mental qualities are abandoned and bright mental qualities have grown, and one enters &amp; remains in the culmination &amp; abundance of discernment, having known &amp; realized it for oneself in the here &amp; now, there is joy, rapture, serenity, mindfulness, alertness, and a pleasant/happy abiding.</p>
<p>"I also teach the Dhamma for the abandoning of the mind-made acquisition of a self... for the abandoning of the formless acquisition of a self, such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter &amp; remain in the culmination &amp; abundance of discernment, having known &amp; realized it for yourself in the here &amp; now...

<p>"In the past, I have been asked, 'What, friend, is the gross acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma such that, when you practice it, defiling mental qualities will be abandoned, bright mental qualities will grow, and you will enter &amp; remain in the culmination &amp; abundance of discernment, having known &amp; realized it for yourself in the here &amp; now?' When asked this, I would answer, <i>'This,</i> friend, is that gross acquisition of a self for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma...'</p>
<p>"In the past, I have been asked, 'What, friend, is the mind-made acquisition of a self... the formless acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma...?' When asked this, I would answer, <i>'This,</i> friend, is that gross acquisition of a self for whose abandoning I teach the Dhamma...'</p>
<p>"What do you think, Potthapada. When this is the case, don't those words turn out to be convincing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord. When this is the case, those words turn out to be convincing."</p>
<p>"Potthapada, it's as if a man at a crossroads were to build a staircase for ascending to a palace, and other people were to say to him, 'Well, my good man, this palace for which you are building a staircase: do you know whether it's east, west, north, or south of here? Whether it's high, low, or in between?' He would say, <i>'This,</i> friends, is the palace to which I am building a staircase. The staircase is right under the palace.'</p>
<p>"So what do you think, Potthapada &mdash; when this is the case, don't the words of that man turn out to be convincing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord..."</p>
<p>"In the same way, in the past I have been asked, 'What, friend, is the gross acquisition of a self... the mind-made acquisition of a self... the formless acquisition of a self for whose abandoning you teach the Dhamma...?'

<p>"Yes, lord. When this is the case, those words turn out to be convincing."</p>
<p>When this was said, Citta the elephant trainer's son said to the Blessed One: "When there is a gross acquisition of a self, is it the case then that one's mind-made acquisition of a self and formless acquisition of a self are null &amp; void, and only one's gross acquisition of a self is true? And when there is a mind-made acquisition of a self, is it the case then that one's gross acquisition of a self and formless acquisition of a self are null &amp; void, and only one's mind-made acquisition of a self is true? And when there is a formless acquisition of a self, is it the case then that one's gross acquisition of a self and mind-made acquisition of a self are null &amp; void, and only one's formless acquisition of a self is true?"</p>
<p>"Citta, when there is a gross acquisition of a self, it's not classified either as a mind-made acquisition of a self or as a formless acquisition of a self. It's classified just as a gross acquisition of a self. When there is a mind-made acquisition of a self, it's not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a formless acquisition of a self. It's classified just as a mind-made acquisition of a self. When there is a formless acquisition of a self, it's not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mind-made acquisition of a self. It is classified just as a formless acquisition of a self.</p>
<p>"Suppose they were to ask you: 'Did you exist in the past? Did you not not exist? Will you exist in the future? Will you not not exist? Do you exist now? Do you not not exist?' Thus asked, how would you answer?"</p>
<p>"... Thus asked, lord, I would answer: 'I existed in the past. I did not not exist. I will exist in the future. I will not not exist. I exist now. I do not not exist.'... That's how I would answer."</p>
<p>"Suppose, Citta, they were to ask you: 'Whatever your past acquisition of a self: Is that alone your true acquisition of self, while the future &amp; present ones are null &amp; void? Whatever your future acquisition of a self: Is that alone your true acquisition of a self, while the past &amp; present ones are null &amp; void? Whatever your present acquisition of a self: Is that alone your true acquisition of a self, while the past &amp; future ones are null &amp; void?' Thus asked, how would you answer?"</p>
<p>"...Thus asked, lord, I would answer: 'Whatever my past acquisition of a self: on that occasion, that alone was my true acquisition of a self, while future &amp; present ones were null &amp; void. Whatever my future acquisition of a self: on that occasion, that alone will be my true acquisition of a self, while the past &amp; present ones will be null &amp; void. Whatever my present acquisition of a self: on that occasion, that alone is my true acquisition of a self, while the past &amp; future ones are null &amp; void.</p>
<p>"In the same way, Citta, when there is a gross acquisition of a self... it's classified just as a gross acquisition of a self. When there is a mind-made acquisition of a self... When there is a formless acquisition of a self, it's not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mind-made acquisition of a self. It's classified just as a formless acquisition of a self.</p>
<p>"<a id="milk">Just as</a> when milk comes from a cow, curds from milk, butter from curds, ghee from butter, and the skimmings of ghee from ghee. When there is milk, it's not classified as curds, butter, ghee, or skimmings of ghee. It's classified just as milk. When there are curds... When there is butter... When there is ghee... When there are the skimmings of ghee, they're not classified as milk, curds, butter, or ghee. They're classified just as the skimmings of ghee.</p>
<p>"In the same way, when there is a gross acquisition of a self... it's classified just as a gross acquisition of a self. When there is a mind-made acquisition of a self... When there is a formless acquisition of a self, it's not classified either as a gross acquisition of a self or as a mind-made acquisition of a self. It's classified just as a formless acquisition of a self.</p>
<p>"Citta, these are the world's designations, the world's expressions, the world's ways of speaking, the world's descriptions, with which the Tathagata expresses himself but without grasping to them." <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10' id='fnt-10'>[10]</a></p>
<p><a id="potthapada-magnif">When this was said</a>, Potthapada the wanderer said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama &mdash; through many lines of reasoning &mdash; made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>
<p><a id="citta-magnif">But</a> Citta the elephant trainer's son said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent!

I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. Let me obtain the Going Forth in the Blessed One's presence! Let me obtain Acceptance!"</p>
<p><a id="citta-arahant">So Citta</a> the elephant trainer's son obtained the Going Forth in the Blessed One's presence; he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance &mdash; dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute &mdash; he in no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And thus Ven. Elephant-trainer's Son <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-11' id='fnt-11'>[11]</a> became another one of the arahants.</p>

	<dd>Non-percipient <i>(asa&ntilde;&ntilde;ii):</i> This term is sometimes translated as "unconscious," but because the Buddha is so strict throughout this sutta in referring to <i>sa&ntilde;&ntilde;aa</i> as it functions in other suttas &mdash; as "perception," i.e., the labels one attaches to experience &mdash; translating asa&ntilde;&ntilde;ii as "unconscious" creates needless confusion, especially as some readers might assume that the term would mean the absence of <i>vi&ntilde;&ntilde;aa.na.</i> An asa&ntilde;&ntilde;ii person might better be conceived as one in a mentally blank state.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-4" id="fn-4">4</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Maurice Walshe, in <i>The Long Discourses of the Buddha</i> (LDB), mistakenly has "arises" here.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-5" id="fn-5">5</a>.</dt>
	<dd>LDB omits "alert" here. (There are many other mistakes in the LDB translation of this sutta, but as it would be tedious to note them all, I am noting only these two, to alert the reader to the fact that the sloppiness that unfortunately mars much of LDB is particularly evident in its translation of this sutta.)</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-6" id="fn-6">6</a>.</dt>
	<dd>As <a href="../an/an09/an09.036.than.html">AN 9.36</a> points out, one can attain cessation based on any of the levels of jhana. Thus, although the specific level from which cessation is attained might differ from person to person, its role in functioning as the basis for cessation is the same in every person's Awakening.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-7" id="fn-7">7</a>.</dt>
	<dd>According to the Commentary, the word "this" here refers to the perception characterizing the level of jhana from which one attained the knowledge of cessation.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-8" id="fn-8">8</a>.</dt>
	<dd>See the section on the mind-made body in <a href="dn.02.0.than.html">DN 2</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-9" id="fn-9">9</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Acquisition of a self <i>(atta-pa.tilaabho):</i> According to the Commentary, this refers to the acquisition of an individual identity <i>(attabhaava-pa.tilaabho)</i> on any of the three levels of becoming: the sensual level, the level of form, and the formless level. The term <i>attabhaava-pa.tilaabho</i> is used in a number of suttas &mdash; among them <a href="../an/an04/an04.192.than.html">AN 4.192</a> &mdash; where it definitely refers to the type of identity one assumes on experiencing rebirth in a particular level of being. However, there are two reasons for not following the Commentary's equation of <i>atta-pa.tilaabho</i> with <i>attabhaava-pa.tilaabho</i>. (1) As AN 4.72 makes clear, there is a type of <i>attabhaava-pa.tilaabho &mdash;</i> rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception &mdash; that would not be covered by any of the three types of acquisition of a self mentioned in this sutta. Thus the Buddha seems to be limiting his discussion here to the alternative selves posited by Potthapada. (2) In a later passage in this sutta, the Buddha refers to the acquisition of a self as something he can point to directly in his listeners' immediate range of experience. Thus the term would seem to refer to the sense of self one can attain as a result of different levels of experience in meditation here and now.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-10" id="fn-10">10</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The Commentary takes this is as the Buddha's affirmation of the idea &mdash; which in later centuries became current in all schools of Buddhism &mdash; that he spoke truth on two levels: conventional and ultimate. In context, though, the Buddha seems to be referring merely to the fact that he has adopted the linguistic usages of his interlocutors simply for the sake of discussion, and that they should not be interpreted out of context.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-11" id="fn-11">11</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Mv.I.74 indicates that it was considered a sign of respect to refer to a monk by his clan name.</dd>

[SUMMARY]={This discourse explores the role of miracles and conversations with heavenly beings as a possible basis for faith and belief. The Buddha does not deny the reality of such experiences, but he points out that &mdash; of all possible miracles &mdash; the only reliable one is the miracle of instruction in the proper training of the mind. As for heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion, and so the information they give &mdash; especially with regard to the miracle of instruction &mdash; is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus the only valid basis for faith is the instruction that, when followed, brings about the end of one's own mental defilements. The tale that concludes the discourse is one of the finest examples of the early Buddhist sense of humor.}

<div class="chapter">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a id="nalanda">Nalanda</a> in <a id="pavarika">Pavarika</a>'s mango grove. Then <a id="kevatta">Kevatta the householder</a> approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Lord, this Nalanda is powerful, both prosperous and populous, filled with people who have faith in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One."</p>
<p><a id="drawbacks">When</a> this was said, the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder, "Kevatta, I don't teach the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, display a miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in white.'"</p>
<p>A second time... A third time, Kevatta the householder said to the Blessed One: "I won't argue with the Blessed One, but I tell you: Lord, this Nalanda is powerful, both prosperous and populous, filled with people who have faith in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One were to direct a monk to display a miracle of psychic power from his superior human state so that Nalanda would to an even greater extent have faith in the Blessed One."</p>
<p>A third time, the Blessed One said to Kevatta the householder, "Kevatta, I don't teach the monks in this way: 'Come, monks, display a miracle of psychic power to the lay people clad in white.'</p>
<p>"Kevatta, there are these <a id="miracles3">three miracles</a> that I have declared, having directly known and realized them for myself. Which three? The miracle of psychic power, the miracle of telepathy, and the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4>The Miracle of Psychic Power</h4>
<p>"And what is the miracle of psychic power? There is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>
<p>"Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him wielding manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction, telling him, 'Isn't it awesome. Isn't it astounding, how great the power, how great the prowess of this contemplative. Just now I saw him wielding manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.'</p>
<p>"Then the person without faith, without conviction, would say to the person with faith and with conviction: 'Sir, there is a charm called the Gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.' What do you think, Kevatta &mdash; isn't that what the man without faith, without conviction, would say to the man with faith and with conviction?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord, that's just what he would say."</p>
<p>"Seeing this drawback to the miracle of psychic power, Kevatta, I feel horrified, humiliated, and disgusted with the miracle of psychic power.</p>

<h4>The Miracle of Telepathy</h4>
<p>"And what is the miracle of telepathy? There is the case where a monk reads the minds, the mental events, the thoughts, the ponderings of other beings, other individuals, [saying,] 'Such is your thinking, here is where your thinking is, thus is your mind.'</p>
<p>"Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him reading the minds... of other beings... He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction, telling him, 'Isn't it awesome. Isn't it astounding, how great the power, how great the prowess of this contemplative. Just now I saw him reading the minds... of other beings...'</p>
<p>"Then the person without faith, without conviction, would say to the person with faith and with conviction: 'Sir, there is a charm called the Manika charm by which the monk read the minds... of other beings...' What do you think, Kevatta &mdash; isn't that what the man without faith, without conviction, would say to the man with faith and with conviction?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord, that's just what he would say."</p>
<p>"Seeing this drawback to the miracle of telepathy, Kevatta, I feel horrified, humiliated, and disgusted with the miracle of telepathy.</p>

<h4>The Miracle of Instruction</h4>
<p>"And what is the miracle of instruction? There is the case where a monk gives instruction in this way: 'Direct your thought in this way, don't direct it in that. Attend to things in this way, don't attend to them in that. Let go of this, enter and remain in that.' This, Kevatta, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, there is the case where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars and in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure.</p>
<p>"A householder or householder's son, hearing the Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: '<a id="dusty">Household life is confining</a>, a dusty path. The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, <a id="shell">like a polished shell</a>. What if I were to shave off my hair and beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'</p>
<p>"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>
<p>"When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Consummate in his virtue, he guards the doors of his senses, is possessed of mindfulness and alertness, and is content.</p>

<h4><a id="virtue">The Lesser Section on Virtue</a></h4>
<p>"And how is a monk consummate in virtue? Abandoning the taking of life, he abstains from the taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings. This is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is not given. He takes only what is given, accepts only what is given, lives not by stealth but by means of a self that has become pure. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Abandoning uncelibacy, he lives a celibate life, aloof, refraining from the sexual act that is the villager's way. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Abandoning divisive speech he abstains from divisive speech. What he has heard here he does not tell there to break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there he does not tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united, he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create concord. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the heart, that are polite, appealing and pleasing to people at large. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Abandoning idle chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, and the Vinaya. He speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed, connected with the goal. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"He abstains from damaging seed and plant life.</p>
<p>"He eats only once a day, refraining from the evening meal and from food at the wrong time of day.</p>
<p>"He abstains from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and from watching shows.</p>
<p>"He abstains from wearing garlands and from beautifying himself with scents and cosmetics.</p>
<p>"He abstains from high and luxurious beds and seats.</p>
<p>"He abstains from accepting gold and money.</p>
<p>"He abstains from accepting uncooked grain... raw meat... women and girls... male and female slaves... goats and sheep... fowl and pigs... elephants, cattle, steeds, and mares... fields and property.</p>
<p>"He abstains from running messages... from buying and selling... from dealing with false scales, false metals, and false measures... from bribery, deception, and fraud.</p>
<p>"He abstains from mutilating, executing, imprisoning, highway robbery, plunder, and violence.</p>
<p>"This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>

<h4>The Intermediate Section on Virtue</h4>
<p>"Whereas some brahmans and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to damaging seed and plant life such as these &mdash; plants propagated from roots, stems, joints, buddings, and seeds &mdash; he abstains from damaging seed and plant life such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Whereas some brahmans and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to consuming stored-up goods such as these &mdash; stored-up food, stored-up drinks, stored-up clothing, stored-up vehicles, stored-up bedding, stored-up scents, and stored-up meat &mdash; he abstains from consuming stored-up goods such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"<a id="shows">Whereas some</a> brahmans and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to watching shows such as these &mdash; dancing, singing, instrumental music, plays, ballad recitations, hand-clapping, cymbals and drums, magic lantern scenes, acrobatic and conjuring tricks, elephant fights, horse fights, buffalo fights, bull fights, goat fights, ram fights, cock fights, quail fights; fighting with staves, boxing, wrestling, war-games, roll calls, battle arrays, and regimental reviews &mdash; he abstains from watching shows such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Whereas some brahmans and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to heedless and idle games such as these &mdash; eight-row chess, ten-row chess, chess in the air, hopscotch, spillikins, dice, stick games, hand-pictures, ball-games, blowing through toy pipes, playing with toy plows, turning somersaults, playing with toy windmills, toy measures, toy chariots, toy bows, guessing letters drawn in the air, guessing thoughts, mimicking deformities &mdash; he abstains from heedless and idle games such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"<a id="luxury">Whereas some</a> brahmans and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to high and luxurious furnishings such as these &mdash; over-sized couches, couches adorned with carved animals, long-haired coverlets, multi-colored patchwork coverlets, white woolen coverlets, woolen coverlets embroidered with flowers or animal figures, stuffed quilts, coverlets with fringe, silk coverlets embroidered with gems; large woolen carpets; elephant, horse, and chariot rugs, antelope-hide rugs, deer-hide rugs; couches with awnings, couches with red cushions for the head and feet &mdash; he abstains from using high and luxurious furnishings such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"<a id="scents">Whereas some brahmans</a> and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to scents, cosmetics, and means of beautification such as these &mdash; rubbing powders into the body, massaging with oils, bathing in perfumed water, kneading the limbs, using mirrors, ointments, garlands, scents, creams, face-powders, mascara, bracelets, head-bands, decorated walking sticks, ornamented water-bottles, swords, fancy sunshades, decorated sandals, turbans, gems, yak-tail whisks, long-fringed white robes &mdash; he abstains from using scents, cosmetics, and means of beautification such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"<a id="speech">Whereas some brahmans</a> and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to talking about lowly topics such as these &mdash; talking about kings, robbers, ministers of state; armies, alarms, and battles; food and drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, and scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women and heroes; the gossip of the street and the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity [philosophical discussions of the past and future], the creation of the world and of the sea, and talk of whether things exist or not &mdash; he abstains from talking about lowly topics such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"Whereas some brahmans and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to debates such as these &mdash; '<i>You</i> understand this doctrine and discipline? <i>I'm</i> the one who understands this doctrine and discipline. How could you understand this doctrine and discipline? You're practicing wrongly. I'm practicing rightly. I'm being consistent. You're not. What should be said first you said last. What should be said last you said first. What you took so long to think out has been refuted. Your doctrine has been overthrown. You're defeated.

<p>"Whereas some brahmans and contemplatives, living off food given in faith, are addicted to running messages and errands for people such as these &mdash; kings, ministers of state, noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or youths [who say], 'Go here, go there, take this there, fetch that here' &mdash; he abstains from running messages and errands for people such as these.

</blockquote>
<p>he abstains from wrong livelihood, from lowly arts such as these. This, too, is part of his virtue.</p>
<p>"A monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue. <a id="king">Just as</a> a head-anointed noble warrior king who has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies, in the same way the monk thus consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue. Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless. This is how a monk is consummate in virtue.</p>

<h4>Sense Restraint</h4>
<p>"And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses? On seeing a form with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which &mdash; if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye &mdash; evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear... On smelling an odor with the nose... On tasting a flavor with the tongue... On touching a tactile sensation with the body... On cognizing an idea with the intellect, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which &mdash; if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect &mdash; evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. Endowed with this noble restraint over the sense faculties, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless. This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses.</p>

<h4>Mindfulness &amp; Alertness</h4>
<p>"And how is a monk possessed of mindfulness and alertness? When going forward and returning, he acts with alertness. When looking toward and looking away... when bending and extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe, and his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting... when urinating and defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and remaining silent, he acts with alertness. This is how a monk is possessed of mindfulness and alertness.</p>

<h4>Contentedness</h4>
<p>"And how is a monk content? <a id="bird">Just as a bird</a>, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden; so too is he content with a set of robes to provide for his body and almsfood to provide for his hunger. Wherever he goes, he takes only his barest necessities along. This is how a monk is content.</p>

<h4>Abandoning the Hindrances</h4>
<p>"Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and alertness, and this noble contentment, he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a forest, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore.</p>
<p>"Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger. Abandoning sloth &amp; drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth &amp; drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth &amp; drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness and anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty.</p>
<p>"<a id="loan">Suppose that a man</a>, taking a loan, invests it in his business affairs. His business affairs succeed. He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, taking a loan, I invested it in my business affairs. Now my business affairs have succeeded. I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>
<p>"<a id="sick">Now suppose that a man</a> falls sick &mdash; in pain and seriously ill. He does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time passes, he eventually recovers from that sickness. He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was sick... Now I am recovered from that sickness. I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>
<p>"<a id="prison">Now suppose that a man</a> is bound in prison. As time passes, he eventually is released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was bound in prison. Now I am released from that bondage, safe and sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>
<p>"<a id="slave">Now suppose that a man</a> is a slave, subject to others, not subject to himself, unable to go where he likes. As time passes, he eventually is released from that slavery, subject to himself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where he likes. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was a slave... Now I am released from that slavery, subject to myself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where I like.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>
<p>"<a id="safe">Now suppose that a man</a>, carrying money and goods, is traveling by a road through desolate country. As time passes, he eventually emerges from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, carrying money and goods, I was traveling by a road through desolate country. Now I have emerged from that desolate country, safe and sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy and happiness.</p>
<p>"In the same way, when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security. Seeing that they have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<h4>The Four Jhanas</h4>
<p>"Quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal. <a id="bathman">Just as if a skilled bathman</a> or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again and again with water, so that his ball of bath powder &mdash; saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within and without &mdash; would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters and remains in the second jhana: rapture and pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure. <a id="lake">Just like a lake</a> with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies supplying abundant showers time and again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate and pervade, suffuse and fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of composure.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>
<p>"And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. <a id="pond">Just as in a lotus pond</a>, some of the lotuses, born and growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated and pervaded, suffused and filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>
<p>"And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure and stress &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress &mdash; he enters and remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure nor stress. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. <a id="cloth">Just as if a man</a> were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4>Insight Knowledge</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' <a id="gem">Just as if there were</a> a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water &mdash; eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread &mdash; and a man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects. And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.'</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4>The Mind-made Body</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. <a id="reed">Just as if a man</a> were to draw a reed from its sheath. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' <a id="sword">Or as if a man</a> were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' <a id="snake">Or as if a man</a> were to pull a snake out from its slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4>Supranormal Powers</h4>
<p>"<a id="supranormal">With his mind</a> thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. <a id="potter">Just as a skilled potter</a> or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes, <a id="carver">or as a skilled ivory-carver</a> or his assistant could craft from well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, <a id="gold">or as a skilled goldsmith</a> or his assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers... He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4><a id="clairaudience">Clairaudience</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears &mdash; by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far. <a id="drums">Just as if a man</a> traveling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, and tom-toms. He would know, 'That is the sound of kettledrums, that is the sound of small drums, that is the sound of conchs, that is the sound of cymbals, and that is the sound of tom-toms.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears &mdash; by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4><a id="mindreading">Mind Reading</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion. He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind. <a id="reflection">Just as if a young woman</a> &mdash; or man &mdash; fond of ornaments, examining the reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know 'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not. In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion... a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4><a id="recollection">Recollection of Past Lives</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details. <a id="village">Just as if a man</a> were to go from his home village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives... in their modes and details.</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4><a id="beings">The Passing Away &amp; Re-appearance of Beings</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings &mdash; who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings &mdash; who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma. <a id="building">Just as if there were a tall building</a> in the central square [of a town], and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house, leaving it, walking along the street, and sitting in the central square. The thought would occur to him, 'These people are entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and sitting in the central square.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma...</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>

<h4><a id="asava">The Ending of Mental Fermentations</a></h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' <a id="pool">Just as if there were</a> a pool of water in a mountain glen &mdash; clear, limpid, and unsullied &mdash; where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, and unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>
<p>"This, too, is called the miracle of instruction.</p>
<p>"These are the three miracles that I declare, Kevatta, having directly known and realized them for myself.</p>

<h4><a id="gods">Conversations with the Gods</a></h4>
<p>"Once, Kevatta, this train of thought arose in the awareness of a certain monk in this very community of monks: 'Where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?' Then he attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods appeared in his centered mind. So he approached the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the gods of the retinue of the Four Great Kings said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there are the Four Great Kings who are higher and more sublime than we. They should know where the four great elements... cease without remainder.'</p>
<p>"So the monk approached the Four Great Kings and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements... cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the Four Great Kings said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there are the gods of the Thirty-three who are higher and more sublime than we. They should know...'</p>
<p>"So the monk approached the gods of the Thirty-three and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements... cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the gods of the Thirty-three said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there is Sakka, the ruler of the gods, who is higher and more sublime than we. He should know... '</p>
<p>"So the monk approached Sakka, the ruler of the gods, and, on arrival, asked him, 'Friend, where do these four great elements... cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, Sakka, the ruler of the gods, said to the monk, 'I also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there are the <a id="yama">Yama</a> gods who are higher and more sublime than I. They should know...'...</p>
<p>"The Yama gods said, 'We also don't know... But there is the god named <a id="suyama">Suyama</a>... He should know...'...</p>
<p>"Suyama said, 'I also don't know... But there is the god named <a id="santusita">Santusita</a>... He should know...'...</p>
<p>"Santusita said, 'I also don't know... But there are the <a id="nimmanarati">Nimmanarati</a> gods... They should know...'...</p>
<p>"The Nimmanarati gods said, 'We also don't know... But there is the god named <a id="sunimmita">Sunimmita</a>... He should know...'...</p>
<p>"Sunimmita said, 'I also don't know... But there are the <a id="paranimm">Paranimmitavasavatti</a> gods... They should know...'...</p>
<p>"The Paranimmitavasavatti gods said, 'We also don't know... But there is the god named Paranimmita <a id="vasavatti">Vasavatti</a>... He should know...'...</p>
<p>"So the monk approached the god Vasavatti and, on arrival, asked him, 'Friend, where do these four great elements... cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the god Vasavatti said to the monk, 'I also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there are the gods of the retinue of Brahma who are higher and more sublime than I. They should know where the four great elements... cease without remainder'...</p>
<p>"Then the monk attained to such a state of concentration that the way leading to the gods of the retinue of Brahma appeared in his centered mind. So he approached the gods of the retinue of Brahma and, on arrival, asked them, 'Friends, where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the gods of the retinue of Brahma said to the monk, 'We also don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. But there is <a id="brahma2">Brahma</a>, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. He is higher and more sublime than we. He should know where the four great elements... cease without remainder.'</p>
<p>"'But where, friends, is the Great Brahma now?'</p>
<p>"'Monk, we also don't know where Brahma is or in what way Brahma is. But when signs appear, light shines forth, and a radiance appears, Brahma will appear. For these are the portents of Brahma's appearance: light shines forth and a radiance appears.'</p>
<p>"<a id="bigbrahma">Then</a> it was not long before Brahma appeared.</p>
<p>"So the monk approached the Great Brahma and, on arrival, said, 'Friend, where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?'</p>
<p>"When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.'</p>
<p>A second time, the monk said to the Great Brahma, 'Friend, I didn't ask you if you were Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. I asked you where these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder.'</p>
<p>"A second time, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.'</p>
<p>"A third time, the monk said to the Great Brahma, 'Friend, I didn't ask you if you were Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. I asked you where these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder.'</p>
<p>"Then the Great Brahma, taking the monk by the arm and leading him off to one side, said to him, 'These gods of the retinue of Brahma believe, "There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not know. There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not see. There is nothing of which the Great Brahma is unaware. There is nothing that the Great Brahma has not realized." That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However he answers it, you should take it to heart.'</p>
<p>"Then &mdash; just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm &mdash; the monk disappeared from the Brahma world and immediately appeared in front of me. Having bowed down to me, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to me, 'Lord, where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder?'</p>
<p><a id="shore">"When</a> this was said, I said to him,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> 'Once, monk, some sea-faring merchants took a shore-sighting bird and set sail in their ship. When they could not see the shore, they released the shore-sighting bird. It flew to the east, south, west, north, straight up, and to all the intermediate points of the compass. If it saw the shore in any direction, it flew there. If it did not see the shore in any direction, it returned right back to the ship. In the same way, monk, having gone as far as the Brahma world in search of an answer to your question, you have come right back to my presence.</p>
<p>"'Your question should not be phrased in this way: Where do these four great elements &mdash; the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property &mdash; cease without remainder? Instead, it should be phrased like this:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Where do water, earth, fire, &amp; wind
	have no footing?
Where are long &amp; short,
	coarse &amp; fine,
	fair &amp; foul,
	name &amp; form
brought to an end?
</div>

<p>"'And the answer to that is:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Consciousness without feature,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> 
	   without end,
	luminous all around:
Here water, earth, fire, &amp; wind
	have no footing.
Here long &amp; short
	coarse &amp; fine
	fair &amp; foul
	name &amp; form
are all brought to an end.
With the cessation of [the activity of] consciousness
	each is here brought to an end.'"
</div>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Kevatta the householder delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

<div class="notes">
<h1>Notes</h1>
<dl>
<dt><a href="#fnt-1" id="fn-1">1</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Vi&ntilde;&ntilde;anam anidassanam.</i> This term is nowhere explained in the Canon, although MN 49 mentions that it "does not partake in the allness of the All" &mdash; the "All" meaning the six internal and six external sense media (see <a href="../sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html">SN 35.23</a>). In this it differs from the consciousness factor in dependent co-arising, which is defined in terms of the six sense media. Lying outside of time and space, it would also not come under the consciousness-aggregate, which covers all consciousness near and far; past, present, and future. However, the fact that it is outside of time and space &mdash; in a dimension where there is no here, there, or in between (<a href="../kn/ud/ud.1.10.than.html">Ud 1.10</a>), no coming, no going, or staying (<a href="../kn/ud/ud.8.01.than.html">Ud 8.1</a>) &mdash; means that it cannot be described as permanent or omnipresent, terms that have meaning only within space and time. The standard description of nibbana after death is, "All that is sensed, not being relished, will grow cold right here." (See <a href="../mn/mn.140.than.html">MN 140</a> and <a href="../kn/iti/iti.2.028-049.than.html#iti-044">Iti 44</a>.) Again, as "all" is defined as the sense media, this raises the question as to whether consciousness without feature is not covered by this "all." However, <a href="../an/an04/an04.174.than.html">AN 4.174</a> warns that any speculation as to whether anything does or doesn't remain after the remainderless stopping of the six sense media is to "objectify non-objectification," which gets in the way of attaining the non-objectified. Thus this is a question that is best put aside.</dd>

<div class="chapter">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the <a id="kos">Kosalans</a> with a large community of monks &mdash; approximately 500 monks in all &mdash; and arrived at <a id="sal">Salavatika</a>. Now at that time the <a id="loh">brahman Lohicca</a> was reigning with feudatory rights over Salavatika &mdash; together with its wealth, grass, timber, &amp; grain &mdash; through a royal grant bestowed by <a id="pas">King Pasenadi Kosala</a>. And at that time an evil viewpoint to this effect had arisen to him: "Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?"</p>
<p>Then Lohicca heard it said, "Gotama the contemplative &mdash; the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan &mdash; on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks &mdash; approximately 500 monks in all &mdash; has arrived at Salavatika. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, teacher of human &amp; divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known &mdash; having realized it through direct knowledge &mdash; this world with its devas, maras, &amp; brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives &amp; brahmans, their rulers &amp; common people; has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.'"</p>
<p>So Lohicca said to <a id="ros">Rosika</a> the barber: "Come, dear Rosika. Go to Gotama the contemplative and, on arrival, ask whether he is free from illness &amp; affliction, is carefree, strong, &amp; living in comfort, saying: 'The brahman Lohicca, Master Gotama, asks whether you are free from illness &amp; affliction, are carefree, strong, &amp; living in comfort.' And then say: 'May Master Gotama, together with the community of monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahman Lohicca.'"</p>
<p>Responding, "As you say, sir," to the brahman Lohicca, Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowing down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "The brahman Lohicca, lord, asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness &amp; affliction, is carefree, strong, &amp; living in comfort. And he says, 'May the Blessed One, together with the community of monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahman Lohicca.'" The Blessed One consented through silence.</p>
<p>Then Rosika the barber, understanding the Blessed One's consent, rose from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him &mdash; keeping him to his right &mdash; and returned to the brahman Lohicca. On arrival he said to him, "I have informed the Blessed One of your words, [saying,] 'The brahman Lohicca, lord, asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness &amp; affliction, is carefree, strong, &amp; living in comfort. And he says, "May the Blessed One, together with the community of monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahman Lohicca."' And the Blessed One has consented."</p>
<p>Then, as the night was ending, the brahman Lohicca had choice staple &amp; non-staple foods prepared in his own home and then said to Rosika the barber, "Come, dear Rosika. Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival announce the time, [saying,] 'It is time, Master Gotama. The meal is ready.'"</p>
<p>Responding, "As you say, sir," to the brahman Lohicca, Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowing down to him, stood to one side. As he was standing there, he announced the time, [saying,] "It is time, lord. The meal is ready."</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having put on his robes early in the morning, carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe, went together with a community of monks to Salavatika. Meanwhile, Rosika the barber was following right behind the Blessed One and said to him, "Lord, an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to the brahman Lohicca: 'Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' It would be good if the Blessed One would extract the brahman Lohicca from this evil viewpoint."</p>
<p>"Perhaps that will be, Rosika. Perhaps that will be."</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One went to the brahman Lohicca's home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. The brahman Lohicca, with his own hand, served &amp; satisfied the Blessed One &amp; the community of monks with choice staple &amp; non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, the brahman Lohicca took a lower seat and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Is it true, Lohicca, that an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to you: 'Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?'?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"What do you think, Lohicca. Don't you reign over Salavatika?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"Now, suppose someone were to say, 'The brahman Lohicca reigns over Salavatika. He alone should consume the fruits &amp; revenues of Salavatika, and not share them with others.' Would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for your subjects, or would he not?"</p>
<p>"He would be a creator of obstacles, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"And, being a creator of obstacles, would he be sympathetic for their welfare or not?"</p>
<p>"He would not be sympathetic for their welfare, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"And in one not sympathetic for their welfare, would his mind be established in good will for them, or in animosity?"</p>
<p>"In animosity, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"When the mind is established in animosity, is there wrong view or right view?"</p>
<p>"Wrong view, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"Now, for one of wrong view, Lohicca, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb.</p>
<p>"What do you think, Lohicca. Doesn't King Pasenadi Kosala reign over <a id="kasi">Kasi</a> &amp; Kosala?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"Now, suppose someone were to say, 'King Pasenadi Kosala reigns over Kasi &amp; Kosala. He alone should consume the fruits &amp; revenues of Kasi &amp; Kosala, and not share them with others.' Would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for King Pasenadi's subjects &mdash; you &amp; others &mdash; or would he not?"</p>
<p>"He would be a creator of obstacles, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"And, being a creator of obstacles, would he be sympathetic for their welfare or not?"</p>
<p>"He would not be sympathetic for their welfare, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"And in one not sympathetic for their welfare, would his mind be established in good will for them, or in animosity?"</p>
<p>"In animosity, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"When the mind is established in animosity, is there wrong view or right view?"</p>
<p>"Wrong view, Master Gotama."</p>
<p>"Now, for one of wrong view, Lohicca, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb.</p>
<p>"So then, Lohicca, if anyone were to say, 'The brahman Lohicca reigns over Salavatika. He alone should consume the fruits &amp; revenues of Salavatika, and not share them with others,' he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of obstacles for your subjects. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb. In the same way, if anyone were to say, 'Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' &mdash; he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family who, coming to the doctrine &amp; discipline revealed by the Tathagata, attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, the fruit of arahantship; and for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva state. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb.</p>
<p>"And if anyone were to say, 'King Pasenadi Kosala reigns over Kasi &amp; Kosala. He alone should consume the fruits &amp; revenues of Kasi &amp; Kosala, and not share them with others,' he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of obstacles for King Pasenadi's subjects &mdash; you &amp; others. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb. In the same way, if anyone were to say, 'Suppose that a brahman or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond.

Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb.</p>
<p>"<a id="sorts3">Lohicca</a>, there are these three sorts of teacher who are worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes these sorts of teachers, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, &amp; unblameworthy. Which three?</p>
<p>"There is the case where a certain teacher has not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness. He, not having attained that goal of the contemplative life, teaches his disciples, 'This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.' His disciples don't listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an intent for gnosis. They practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions. He should be criticized, saying, 'You, venerable sir, have not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness. Not having attained that goal of the contemplative life, you teach your disciples, "This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness." Your disciples don't listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an intent for gnosis, and practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions. <a id="pursue">It's just as if</a> a man were to pursue [a woman] who pulls away, or to embrace one who turns her back. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' This is the first teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, &amp; unblameworthy.</p>

I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' This is the second teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, &amp; unblameworthy.</p>

This is the third teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, &amp; unblameworthy."</p>
<p>When this was said, the brahman Lohicca said to the Blessed One, "But is there, Master Gotama, any teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the world?"</p>
<p>"There is, Lohicca, a teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the world."</p>
<p>"But which teacher, Master Gotama, is not worthy of criticism in the world?"</p>
<p>"There is the case, Lohicca, where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure.</p>
<p>"A householder or householder's son, hearing the Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: '<a id="dusty">Household life is confining</a>, a dusty path. The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, <a id="shell">like a polished shell</a>. What if I were to shave off my hair &amp; beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'</p>
<p>"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair &amp; beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>
<p>"When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Consummate in his virtue, he guards the doors of his senses, is possessed of mindfulness &amp; alertness, and is content [for details, see <a href="dn.02.0.than.html">DN 2</a>]...</p>

<h4>Abandoning the Hindrances</h4>
<p>"<a id="wild">Endowed</a> with this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness &amp; alertness, and this noble contentment, he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore.</p>
<p>"Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning ill will &amp; anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will &amp; anger. Abandoning sloth &amp; drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth &amp; drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth &amp; drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness &amp; anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness &amp; anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty.</p>
<p>"<a id="loan">Suppose</a> that a man, taking a loan, invests it in his business affairs. His business affairs succeed. He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, taking a loan, I invested it in my business affairs. Now my business affairs have succeeded. I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.</p>
<p>"<a id="ill">Now suppose</a> that a man falls sick &mdash; in pain &amp; seriously ill. He does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time passes, he eventually recovers from that sickness. He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was sick... Now I am recovered from that sickness. I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.</p>
<p>"<a id="prison">Now suppose</a> that a man is bound in prison. As time passes, he eventually is released from that bondage, safe &amp; sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was bound in prison. Now I am released from that bondage, safe &amp; sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.</p>
<p>"<a id="slave">Now suppose</a> that a man is a slave, subject to others, not subject to himself, unable to go where he likes. As time passes, he eventually is released from that slavery, subject to himself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where he likes. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was a slave... Now I am released from that slavery, subject to myself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where I like.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.</p>
<p>"<a id="travel">Now suppose</a> that a man, carrying money &amp; goods, is traveling by a road through desolate country. As time passes, he eventually emerges from that desolate country, safe &amp; sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, carrying money &amp; goods, I was traveling by a road through desolate country. Now I have emerged from that desolate country, safe &amp; sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.</p>
<p>"In the same way, when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security. Seeing that they have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<h4>The Four Jhanas</h4>
<p>"Quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal. <a id="bath">Just as</a> if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again &amp; again with water, so that his ball of bath powder &mdash; saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within &amp; without &mdash; would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. <a id="spring">Just like</a> a lake with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies supplying abundant showers time &amp; again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate &amp; pervade, suffuse &amp; fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>
<p>"And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. <a id="lotus">Just as</a> in a lotus pond, some of the lotuses, born &amp; growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated &amp; pervaded, suffused &amp; filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates... this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>
<p>"And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. <a id="cloth">Just as</a> if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>

<h4>Insight Knowledge</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge &amp; vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother &amp; father, nourished with rice &amp; porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, &amp; dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' <a id="gem">Just as</a> if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water &mdash; eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread &mdash; and a man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects. And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge &amp; vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother &amp; father, nourished with rice &amp; porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, &amp; dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>

<h4>The Mind-made Body</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. <a id="reed">Just as</a> if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, the monk directs &amp; inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>

<h4>Supranormal Powers</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, &amp; mountains as if through space. He dives in &amp; out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches &amp; strokes even the sun &amp; moon, so mighty &amp; powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. <a id="potter">Just as</a> a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes, or as a skilled ivory-carver or his assistant could craft from well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs &amp; inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers... He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>

<h4>Clairaudience</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears &mdash; by means of the divine ear-element, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; both kinds of sounds: divine &amp; human, whether near or far. <a id="drums">Just as</a> if a man traveling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, &amp; tom-toms. He would know, 'That is the sound of kettledrums, that is the sound of small drums, that is the sound of conchs, that is the sound of cymbals, and that is the sound of tom-toms.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs &amp; inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears &mdash; by means of the divine ear-element, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; both kinds of sounds: divine &amp; human, whether near or far. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>

<h4>Mind Reading</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion. He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind. <a id="mirror">Just as</a> if a young woman &mdash; or man &mdash; fond of ornaments, examining the reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know 'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not. In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion... a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>

<h4>Recollection of Past Lives</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes &amp; details. <a id="village">Just as</a> if a man were to go from his home village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives... in their modes &amp; details. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>

<h4>The Passing Away &amp; Re-appearance of Beings</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the passing away &amp; re-appearance of beings. He sees &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings &mdash; who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings &mdash; who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; he sees beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma. <a id="tall">Just as</a> if there were a tall building in the central square [of a town], and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house, leaving it, walking along the street, and sitting in the central square. The thought would occur to him, 'These people are entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and sitting in the central square.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the passing away &amp; re-appearance of beings. He sees &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma... When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.</p>

<h4>The Ending of Mental Fermentations</h4>
<p>"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, the monk directs &amp; inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' <a id="pool">Just as</a> if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen &mdash; clear, limpid, &amp; unsullied &mdash; where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, &amp; pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about &amp; resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, &amp; unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, &amp; pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about &amp; resting.' In the same way &mdash; with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability &mdash; the monk directs &amp; inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are mental fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy."</p>
<p>When this was said, the brahman Lohicca said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, it's <a id="hell">as if</a> a man, having seized by the hair another man who was falling into the pit of hell, were to pull him up &amp; set him on firm ground. In the same way, Master Gotama has pulled me up as I was falling into the pit of hell and has set me on firm ground. <a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama &mdash; through many lines of reasoning &mdash; made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>

<h1>Translator's Introduction</h1>
<p>This is one of the most profound discourses in the Pali canon. It gives an extended treatment of the teachings of dependent co-arising (paticca samuppada) and not-self (anatta) in an outlined context of how these teachings function in practice.</p>
<p>The first part of the discourse takes the factors of dependent co-arising in sequence from effect to cause, tracing them down to the mutual dependency of name-and-form (mental and physical activity) on the one hand, and consciousness on the other. In connection with this point, it is worth noting that the word "great" in the title of the discourse may have a double meaning: modifying the word "discourse" &mdash; it's a long discourse &mdash; and modifying "causes," referring to the fact that name-and-form and consciousness as causal factors can account for everything describable in the cosmos.</p>
<p>After tracing the basic sequence of factors in the causal pattern, the discourse then reviews their inter-relationships, showing how they can explain stress and suffering both on the individual and on the social level.</p>
<p>The second part of the discourse, taking up the teaching of not-self, shows how dependent co-arising gives focus to this teaching in practice. It begins with a section on Delineations of a Self, classifying the various ways in which a sense of "self" might be defined in terms of form. The scheme of analysis introduced in this section &mdash; classifying views of the self according to the variables of form and formless; finite and infinite; already existing, naturally developing in the future, and alterable through human effort &mdash; covers all the theories of the self proposed in the classical Upanisads, as well as all theories of self or soul proposed in more recent times. The inclusion of an infinite self in this list gives the lie to the belief that the Buddha's teachings on not-self were denying nothing more than a sense of "separate" or "limited" self. The discourse points out that even a limitless, infinite, all-embracing sense of self is based on an obsession in the mind that has to be abandoned.</p>
<p>The following section, on Non-delineations of a Self, shows that it is possible for the mind to function without reading a "self" into experience. The remaining sections focus on ways in which this can be done by treating the sense of self as it relates to different aspects of name-and-form. The first of these sections &mdash; Assumptions of a Self &mdash; focuses on the sense of self as it relates to feeling, one of the "name" factors in name-and-form. The next section &mdash; Seven Stations of Consciousness &mdash; focuses on form, formlessness, and perception, which is another one of the "name" factors that allows a place for consciousness to land and grow on the "macro" level in the cycle of death and rebirth. The last section &mdash; Eight Emancipations &mdash; focuses on form, formlessness, and perception on the "micro" level in the practice of meditative absorption (jhana).</p>
<p>In each of these cases, once the sense of attachment and identification with name-and-form can be broken, the mutual dependency between consciousness and name-and-form is broken as well. This brings about total freedom from the limits of "the extent to which there are means of designation, expression, and delineation... the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends, the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting (discernibility) of this world &mdash; i.e., name-and-form together with consciousness." This is the release at which the Buddha's teachings are aimed.</p>

<h4>Dependent Co-arising</h4>
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among the Kurus. Now, the <a id="kuru">Kurus</a> have a town named <a id="kammasadhamma">Kammasadhamma</a>. There <a id="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "It's amazing, lord, it's astounding, how deep this dependent co-arising is, and how deep its appearance, and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be."</p>
<p>[The Buddha:] "Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance. It's because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein, a knotted ball of string, like matted rushes and reeds, and does not go beyond transmigration, beyond the planes of deprivation, woe, and bad destinations.</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for aging and death?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition do aging and death come?' one should say, 'Aging and death come from birth as their requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for birth?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does birth come?' one should say, 'Birth comes from becoming as its requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for becoming?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does becoming come?' one should say, 'Becoming comes from clinging as its requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for clinging?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does clinging come?' one should say, 'Clinging comes from craving as its requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for craving?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does craving come?' one should say, 'Craving comes from feeling as its requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for feeling?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does feeling come?' one should say, 'Feeling comes from contact as its requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for contact?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does contact come?' one should say, 'Contact comes from name-and-form as its requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for name-and-form?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does name-and-form come?' one should say, 'Name-and-form comes from consciousness as its requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for consciousness?' one should answer, 'There is.'</p>
<p>"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does consciousness come?' one should say, 'Consciousness comes from name-and-form as its requisite condition.'</p>
<p>"Thus, Ananda, from name-and-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form. From name-and-form as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging. From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress.</p>

<h4>Aging and Death</h4>
<p>"'From birth as a requisite condition come aging and death.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from birth as a requisite condition come aging and death. If there were no birth at all, in any way, of anything anywhere &mdash; i.e., of devas in the state of devas, of celestials in the state of celestials, of spirits in the state of spirits, of demons in the state of demons, of human beings in the human state, of quadrupeds in the state of quadrupeds, of birds in the state of birds, of snakes in the state of snakes, or of any being in its own state &mdash; in the utter absence of birth, from the cessation of birth, would aging and death be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for aging and death, i.e., birth.</p>

<h4>Birth</h4>
<p>"'From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. If there were no becoming at all, in any way, of anything anywhere &mdash; i.e., sensual becoming, form becoming, or formless becoming &mdash; in the utter absence of becoming, from the cessation of becoming, would birth be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for birth, i.e., becoming.</p>

<h4>Becoming</h4>
<p>"'From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming. If there were no clinging at all, in any way, of anything anywhere &mdash; i.e., clinging to sensuality, clinging to precepts and practices, clinging to views, or clinging to doctrines of the self &mdash; in the utter absence of clinging, from the cessation of clinging, would becoming be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for becoming, i.e., clinging.</p>

<h4>Clinging</h4>
<p>"'From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from craving as a requisite condition comes clinging. If there were no craving at all, in any way, of anything anywhere &mdash; i.e., craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for no becoming &mdash; in the utter absence of craving, from the cessation of craving, would clinging be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for clinging, i.e., craving.</p>

<h4>Craving</h4>
<p>"'From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. If there were no feeling at all, in any way, of anything anywhere &mdash; i.e., feeling born of contact at the eye, feeling born of contact at the ear, feeling born of contact at the nose, feeling born of contact at the tongue, feeling born of contact at the body, or feeling born of contact at the intellect &mdash; in the utter absence of feeling, from the cessation of feeling, would craving be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for craving, i.e., feeling.</p>

<h4>Dependent on Craving</h4>
<p>"Now, craving is dependent on feeling, seeking is dependent on craving, acquisition is dependent on seeking, ascertainment is dependent on acquisition, desire and passion is dependent on ascertainment, attachment is dependent on desire and passion, possessiveness is dependent on attachment, stinginess is dependent on possessiveness, defensiveness is dependent on stinginess, and because of defensiveness, dependent on defensiveness, various evil, unskillful phenomena come into play: the taking up of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and lies.</p>
<p>"And this is the way to understand how it is that because of defensiveness various evil, unskillful phenomena come into play: the taking up of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and lies. If there were no defensiveness at all, in any way, of anything anywhere, in the utter absence of defensiveness, from the cessation of defensiveness, would various evil, unskillful phenomena &mdash; the taking up of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and lies &mdash; come into play?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for the coming-into-play of various evil, unskillful phenomena &mdash; the taking up of sticks and knives; conflicts, quarrels, and disputes; accusations, divisive speech, and lies &mdash; i.e., defensiveness.</p>
<p>"'Defensiveness is dependent on stinginess.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how defensiveness is dependent on stinginess. If there were no stinginess at all, in any way, of anything anywhere, in the utter absence of stinginess, from the cessation of stinginess, would defensiveness be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for defensiveness, i.e., stinginess.</p>
<p>(Similarly back through the chain of conditions: stinginess, attachment, possessiveness, desire and passion, ascertainment, acquisition, and seeking.)</p>
<p>"'Seeking is dependent on craving.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how seeking is dependent on craving. If there were no craving at all, in any way, of anything anywhere &mdash; i.e., craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for no becoming &mdash; in the utter absence of craving, from the cessation of craving, would seeking be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for seeking, i.e., craving. Thus, Ananda, these two phenomena [the chain of conditions leading from craving to birth, aging, and death, and the chain of conditions leading from craving to quarrels, etc.], as a duality, flow back into one place at feeling.</p>

<h4>Feeling</h4>
<p>"'From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. If there were no contact at all, in any way, of anything anywhere &mdash; i.e., contact at the eye, contact at the ear, contact at the nose, contact at the tongue, contact at the body, or contact at the intellect &mdash; in the utter absence of contact, from the cessation of contact, would feeling be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for feeling, i.e., contact.</p>

<h4>Contact</h4>
<p>"'From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition comes contact. Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how, from name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition comes contact. If the qualities, traits, themes, &amp; indicators by which there is a description of name-group (mental activity) were all absent, would designation-contact with regard to the form-group (the physical properties) be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"If the permutations, signs, themes, and indicators by which there is a description of form-group were all absent, would resistance-contact with regard to the name-group be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"If the permutations, signs, themes, and indicators by which there is a description of name-group and form-group were all absent, would designation-contact or resistance-contact be discerned?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for contact, i.e., name-and-form.</p>

<h4>Name-and-form</h4>
<p>"'From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form. If consciousness were not to descend into the mother's womb, would name-and-form take shape in the womb?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"If, after descending into the womb, consciousness were to depart, would name-and-form be produced for this world?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"If the consciousness of the young boy or girl were to be cut off, would name-and-form ripen, grow, and reach maturity?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for name-and-form, i.e., consciousness."</p>

<h4>Consciousness</h4>
<p>"'From name-and-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from name-and-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness. If consciousness were not to gain a foothold in name-and-form, would a coming-into-play of the origination of birth, aging, death, and stress in the future be discerned?</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for consciousness, i.e., name-and-form.</p>
<p>"This is the extent to which there is birth, aging, death, passing away, and re-arising. This is the extent to which there are means of designation, expression, and delineation. This is the extent to which the sphere of discernment extends, the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting (discernibility) of this world &mdash; i.e., name-and-form together with consciousness.</p>

<h4>Delineations of a Self</h4>
<p>"To what extent, Ananda, does one delineate when delineating a self? Either delineating a self possessed of form and finite, one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form and finite.' Or, delineating a self possessed of form and infinite, one delineates that 'My self is possessed of form and infinite.' Or, delineating a self formless and finite, one delineates that 'My self is formless and finite.' Or, delineating a self formless and infinite, one delineates that 'My self is formless and infinite.'</p>
<p>"Now, the one who, when delineating a self, delineates it as possessed of form and finite, either delineates it as possessed of form and finite in the present, or of such a nature that it will [naturally] become possessed of form and finite [in the future/after death], or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite obsesses him.</p>
<p>"The one who, when delineating a self, delineates it as possessed of form and infinite, either delineates it as possessed of form and infinite in the present, or of such a nature that it will [naturally] become possessed of form and infinite [in the future/after death], or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and infinite obsesses him.</p>
<p>"The one who, when delineating a self, delineates it as formless and finite, either delineates it as formless and finite in the present, or of such a nature that it will [naturally] become formless and finite [in the future/after death], or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and finite obsesses him.</p>
<p>"The one who, when delineating a self, delineates it as formless and infinite, either delineates it as formless and infinite in the present, or of such a nature that it will [naturally] become formless and infinite [in the future/after death], or he believes that 'Although it is not yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite obsesses him.</p>

<h4>Non-Delineations of a Self</h4>
<p>"To what extent, Ananda, does one not delineate when not delineating a self? Either not delineating a self possessed of form and finite, one does not delineate that 'My self is possessed of form and finite.' Or, not delineating a self possessed of form and infinite, one does not delineate that 'My self is possessed of form and infinite.' Or, not delineating a self formless and finite, one does not delineate that 'My self is formless and finite.' Or, not delineating a self formless and infinite, one does not delineate that 'My self is formless and infinite.'</p>
<p>"Now, the one who, when not delineating a self, does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite, does not delineate it as possessed of form and finite in the present, nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will [naturally] become possessed of form and finite [in the future/after death], nor does he believe that 'Although it is not yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and finite does not obsess him.</p>
<p>"The one who, when not delineating a self, does not delineate it as possessed of form and infinite, does not delineate it as possessed of form and infinite in the present, nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will [naturally] become possessed of form and infinite [in the future/after death], nor does he believe that 'Although it is not yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self possessed of form and infinite does not obsess him.</p>
<p>"The one who, when not delineating a self, does not delineate it as formless and finite, does not delineate it as formless and finite in the present, nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will [naturally] become formless and finite [in the future/after death], nor does he believe that 'Although it is not yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and finite does not obsess him.</p>
<p>"The one who, when not delineating a self, does not delineate it as formless and infinite, does not delineate it as formless and infinite in the present, nor does he delineate it as of such a nature that it will [naturally] become formless and infinite [in the future/after death], nor does he believe that 'Although it is not yet that way, I will convert it into being that way.' This being the case, it is proper to say that a fixed view of a self formless and infinite does not obsess him.</p>

<h4>Assumptions of a Self</h4>
<p>"To what extent, Ananda, does one assume when assuming a self? Assuming feeling to be the self, one assumes that 'Feeling is my self' [or] 'Feeling is not my self: My self is oblivious [to feeling]' [or] 'Neither is feeling my self, nor is my self oblivious to feeling, but rather my self feels, in that my self is subject to feeling.'</p>
<p>"Now, one who says, 'Feeling is my self,' should be addressed as follows: '<a id="feelings3">There are these</a> three feelings, my friend &mdash; feelings of pleasure, feelings of pain, and feelings of neither pleasure nor pain. Which of these three feelings do you assume to be the self?' At a moment when a feeling of pleasure is sensed, no feeling of pain or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed. Only a feeling of pleasure is sensed at that moment. At a moment when a feeling of pain is sensed, no feeling of pleasure or of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed. Only a feeling of pain is sensed at that moment. At a moment when a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed, no feeling of pleasure or of pain is sensed. Only a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is sensed at that moment.</p>
<p>"Now, a feeling of pleasure is inconstant, fabricated, dependent on conditions, subject to passing away, dissolution, fading, and cessation. A feeling of pain is inconstant, fabricated, dependent on conditions, subject to passing away, dissolution, fading, and cessation. A feeling of neither pleasure nor pain is inconstant, fabricated, dependent on conditions, subject to passing away, dissolution, fading, and cessation. Having sensed a feeling of pleasure as 'my self,' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pleasure, 'my self' has perished. Having sensed a feeling of pain as 'my self,' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of pain, 'my self' has perished. Having sensed a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as 'my self,' then with the cessation of one's very own feeling of neither pleasure nor pain, 'my self' has perished.</p>
<p>"Thus he assumes, assuming in the immediate present a self inconstant, entangled in pleasure and pain, subject to arising and passing away, he who says, 'Feeling is my self.' Thus in this manner, Ananda, one does not see fit to assume feeling to be the self.</p>
<p>"As for the person who says, 'Feeling is not the self: My self is oblivious [to feeling],' he should be addressed as follows: 'My friend, where nothing whatsoever is sensed (experienced) at all, would there be the thought, "I am"?'"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus in this manner, Ananda, one does not see fit to assume that 'Feeling is not my self: My self is oblivious [to feeling].'</p>
<p>"As for the person who says, 'Neither is feeling my self, nor is my self oblivious [to feeling], but rather my self feels, in that my self is subject to feeling,' he should be addressed as follows: 'My friend, should feelings altogether and every way stop without remainder, then with feeling completely not existing, owing to the cessation of feeling, would there be the thought, "I am"?'"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"Thus in this manner, Ananda, one does not see fit to assume that 'Neither is feeling my self, nor is my self oblivious [to feeling], but rather my self feels, in that my self is subject to feeling.'</p>
<p>"Now, Ananda, in as far as a monk does not assume feeling to be the self, nor the self as oblivious, nor that 'My self feels, in that my self is subject to feeling,' then, not assuming in this way, he is not sustained by anything (does not cling to anything) in the world. Unsustained, he is not agitated. Unagitated, he is totally unbound right within. He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>
<p>"If anyone were to say with regard to a monk whose mind is thus released that 'The Tathagata exists after death,' is his view, that would be mistaken; that 'The Tathagata does not exist after death'... that 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death'... that 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' is his view, that would be mistaken. Why? Having directly known the extent of designation and the extent of the objects of designation, the extent of expression and the extent of the objects of expression, the extent of description and the extent of the objects of description, the extent of discernment and the extent of the objects of discernment, the extent to which the cycle revolves: Having directly known that, the monk is released. [To say that,] <i>'The monk released, having directly known that, does not see, does not know</i> is his opinion,' that would be mistaken. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a></p>

<h4><a id="stations7">Seven Stations of Consciousness</a></h4>
<p>"Ananda, there are these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres. Which seven?</p>
<p>"There are beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception, such as human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower realms. This is the first station of consciousness.</p>
<p>"There are beings with diversity of body and singularity of perception, such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first [jhana] and some beings in the four realms of deprivation. This is the second station of consciousness. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a></p>
<p>"There are beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception, such as the Radiant Devas. This is the third station of consciousness.</p>
<p>"There are beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception, such as the Beautifully Lustrous Devas. This is the fourth station of consciousness.</p>
<p>"There are beings who,with the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, [perceiving,] 'Infinite space,' arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of space. This is the fifth station of consciousness.</p>
<p>"There are beings who, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, [perceiving,] 'Infinite consciousness,' arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the sixth station of consciousness.</p>
<p>"There are beings who, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, [perceiving,] 'There is nothing,' arrive at the dimension of nothingness. This is the seventh station of consciousness.</p>
<p>"The dimension of non-percipient beings and, second, the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. [These are the two spheres.]</p>
<p>"Now, as for the first station of consciousness &mdash; beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception, such as human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower realms: If one discerns that [station of consciousness], discerns its origination, discerns its passing away, discerns its allure, discerns its drawbacks, discerns the escape from it, would it be proper, by means of that [discernment] to take delight there?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>(Similarly with each of the remaining stations of consciousness and two spheres.)</p>
<p><a id="drawbacks">"Ananda,</a> when knowing &mdash; as they actually are &mdash; the origination, passing away, allure, drawbacks of &mdash; and escape from &mdash; these seven stations of consciousness and two spheres, a monk is released through lack of clinging, he is said to be a monk released through discernment.</p>

<h4><a id="emancipations8">Eight Emancipations</a></h4>
<p>"Ananda, there are these eight emancipations. Which eight?</p>
<p>"Possessed of form, one sees forms. This is the first emancipation.</p>
<p>"Not percipient of form internally, one sees forms externally. This is the second emancipation.</p>
<p>"One is intent only on the beautiful. This is the third emancipation.</p>
<p>"With the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, [perceiving,] 'Infinite space,' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. This is the fourth emancipation.</p>
<p>"With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, [perceiving,] 'Infinite consciousness,' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the fifth emancipation.</p>
<p>"With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, [perceiving,] 'There is nothing,' one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation.</p>
<p>"With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the seventh emancipation.</p>
<p>"With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is the eighth emancipation.</p>
<p>"Now, when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order, in reverse order, in forward and reverse order, when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants, however he wants, and for as long as he wants, when through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in the fermentation-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having directly known it and realized it in the here and now, he is said to be a monk released in both ways. And as for another release in both ways, higher or more sublime than this, there is none."</p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

<div class="notes">
<h1>Notes</h1>
<dl>
<dt><a href="#fnt-1" id="fn-1">1</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The various readings for this sentence all seem to be corrupt. The sense of the paragraph, read in light of <a href="../an/an10/an10.096.than.html">AN 10.96</a>, demands that the view expressed in the last sentence be <i>about</i> the monk released, unlike the four earlier views, which are wrongly <i>attributed to</i> the monk released. In other words, the monk released has no opinion on the question of whether the Tathagata does, doesn't, etc., exist after death. This might lead to the supposition that his lack of opinion comes from a lack of knowledge or vision. The description of what he comes to know in the course of gaining release shows that this supposition is inappropriate. He does know, he does see, and what he knows and sees about the limitations of language and concepts shows him that the question of the existence of the Tathagata after death should be set aside.
	<p>Thus I would reconstruct the Pali of the final sentence in this paragraph as: <i>Tadabhi&ntilde;&ntilde;aa vimutto bhikkhu na jaanaati na passati iti saa ditthi tadakallam.</i></p>
	</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-2" id="fn-2">2</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This reading follows the Thai edition of the Pali canon. Other editions omit the statement, "and some beings in the four realms of deprivation." However, something like the Thai reading seems called for, inasmuch as the first station of consciousness covers only some of the beings in the lower realms.</dd>

<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>The translation of the Maha-parinibbana Sutta which is offered here is a work of collaboration, but is based upon a text prepared by Sister Vajira of Germany, to whom credit for the initial work must be given. The final revision of the text was done by Mr Francis Story. The notes and references which, it is hoped, will help in the understanding of the text have been contributed by the Venerable Nyanaponika Mahathera, much of the material for them being taken from the Pali Commentary.</p>
<p>Every effort has been made to give a faithful rendering of the original Pali. The greater part of the sutta is straight forward narrative, but it also includes references to profound aspects of the Dhamma, which have to be understood in their precise meaning if the full import of the Buddha's last exhortations is to be conveyed. In the choice which inevitably arises between terminological exactitude and literary form, the translators have endeavored to preserve the former with as little sacrifice as possible of the latter. Those who understand the difficulties of Pali translation will appreciate that this is no easy task, and will readily overlook the absence of those literary graces which only a freer rendering would have permitted.</p>
<p>As in previous translations, some repetitions have been omitted and some repetitive passages condensed.</p>
<p class="tagline">&mdash; Buddhist Publication Society</p>

<h1>Foreword to the Revised Edition</h1>
<p>In this revised edition of <i>Last Days of the Buddha,</i> a number of stylistic changes have been made, aimed at improved readability. The word "Bhagava," untranslated in the original edition, has been replaced by "the Blessed One"; several archaic expressions, which gave a slightly Biblical flavor to the diction, have been replaced by their modern counterparts; awkward sentences have been reformulated; and greater consistency was aimed at in the rendering of certain terms and expressions. The notes have also been revised in certain respects. The titles of the chapters and sections have been supplied by the translator and editors, though the division of the work into six recitation units dates back to the period when the Canon was transmitted orally from one generation to the next.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Of the thirty-four discourses (suttas) that make up the Digha Nikaya (Collection of Long Discourses), ours, the sixteenth, is the longest, and so altogether maintains the first place where length is concerned.</p>
<p>It preserves the principal feature of the Buddhist sutta, insofar as it is, like others, a rehearsal of events as they have been witnessed. On account of its unique composition, however, it is, more than other suttas, capable not only of winning the affection of the pious Buddhist, as it naturally does, but also of attracting the general reader, since it is indeed a fine specimen of sacred universal literature.</p>
<p>It gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching, too, even though it hardly offers anything that is not found &mdash; and often more extensively dealt with &mdash; in other suttas.</p>
<p>At the end of his life, after almost half a century's ministry, the Master had long since taught all that was necessary for attaining the ideal. During the last period his primary concern, therefore, was to impress on his followers the necessity of unflinchingly putting into practice those very same teachings: an appeal that could, of course, hardly fail in stirring their hearts more than ever before.</p>
<p>The Sangha came, indeed, to witness the greatest event in its history, and was keenly aware of it, especially since the Master had announced his Parinibbana three months ahead. The impression on the bhikkhus who flocked to him in large numbers as he was pressing northward was tremendous, and could not fail to be reflected vividly in the oral account. (The Buddhist canon was originally, as is well known, altogether oral.) Because of its particular import and abundance, this material was soon formed into one body; and so our sutta came to be.</p>
<p>In this connection, it is hardly possible not to remember gratefully the Venerable Ananda. His share in the preservation of the Master's word is paramount to any other bhikkhu's, and his figure is inseparable from our texts. This was to become manifest for all time in the Maha-parinibbana Sutta, which is plainly unimaginable without him. For it is Ananda, and again Ananda, whom the Master addresses, having tested for twenty-five years his sure grasp and brilliant memory and also his indefatigable personal devotion. But Ananda too, here more than elsewhere, by his constant queries, worries, and amazements, becomes without intending it a central figure beside the Master himself, which undoubtedly increases the attractiveness of the text. Thus, then, Ananda, gentle and pleasant as his name, and yet almost throughout his career incurring the reproach of the brethren, was immortalized along with his beloved Master, and &mdash; as we may add &mdash; along with his strange position between praise and blame, assuming mystic character in the third chapter.</p>
<p>The third chapter, almost exclusively, is devoted to depicting the circumstances connected with the Master's relinquishment of life, which is the dramatic culmination of events. It overwhelmingly drives home the purely metaphysical significance of the Parinibbana, or at least ought to do so. For the Buddha neither succumbed to his fatal illness nor did he give way to the appeal of Mara (which is identical with the non-appeal of Ananda), but sovereignly let go of existence at a timely hour, just as forty-five years earlier, on becoming fully enlightened, he had duly taken upon himself the wearisome task of teaching men. This fact is most thought-provoking, and consistently leads to the conclusion that by his Parinibbana, indeed, the Buddha bore the last and highest possible testimony to his Teaching, which permits of no lingering inclination to self-preservation and continuance, but on the contrary reaches the highest exultation ending it all. The Master's Parinibbana is, therefore, the one sorrowful event in the history of Buddhism that turns out, in its true meaning, to be really the most blissful.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h1><a id='chap1'>Part One: In Magadha</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p><a id="para-1-1">1.</a> Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> dwelt at <a id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>, on the hill called Vultures' Peak. At that time the <a id="aja">king</a> of <a id="mag">Magadha</a>, Ajatasattu, son of the <a id="videha">Videhi</a> queen, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> desired to wage war against the <a id="vajji">Vajjis</a>. He spoke in this fashion: "These Vajjis, powerful and glorious as they are, I shall annihilate them, I shall make them perish, I shall utterly destroy them."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-2">2.</a> And Ajatasattu, the king of Magadha, addressed his chief minister, the brahman <a id="vas">Vassakara</a>, saying: "Come, brahman, go to the Blessed One, pay homage in my name at his feet, wish him good health, strength, ease, vigour, and comfort, and speak thus: 'O Lord, Ajatasattu, the king of Magadha, desires to wage war against the Vajjis. He has spoken in this fashion: "These Vajjis, powerful and glorious as they are, I shall annihilate them, I shall make them perish, I shall utterly destroy them."' And whatever the Blessed One should answer you, keep it well in mind and inform me; for Tathagatas <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> do not speak falsely."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-3">3.</a> "Very well, sire," said the brahman Vassakara in assent to Ajatasattu, king of Magadha. And he ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready, mounted one himself, and accompanied by the rest, drove out to Rajagaha towards Vultures' Peak. He went by carriage as far as the carriage could go, then dismounting, he approached the Blessed One on foot. After exchanging courteous greetings with the Blessed One, together with many pleasant words, he sat down at one side and addressed the Blessed One thus: "Venerable Gotama, Ajatasattu, the king of Magadha, pays homage at the feet of the Venerable Gotama and wishes him good health, strength, ease, vigour, and comfort. He desires to wage war against the Vajjis, and he has spoken in this fashion: 'These Vajjis, powerful and glorious as they are, I shall annihilate them, I shall make them perish, I shall utterly destroy them.'"</p>

<h2>Conditions of a Nation's Welfare</h2>
<p><a id="para-1-4">4.</a> At that time the Venerable <a id="ananda">Ananda</a> <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4'>[4]</a> was standing behind the Blessed One, fanning him, and the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: "What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis have frequent gatherings, and are their meetings well attended?"</p>
<p>"I have heard, Lord, that this is so."</p>
<p>"So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline.</p>
<p>"What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis assemble and disperse peacefully and attend to their affairs in concord?"</p>
<p>"I have heard, Lord, that they do."</p>
<p>"So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline.</p>
<p>"What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis neither enact new decrees nor abolish existing ones, but proceed in accordance with their ancient constitutions?"</p>
<p>"I have heard, Lord, that they do."</p>
<p>"So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline.</p>
<p>"What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis show respect, honor, esteem, and veneration towards their elders and think it worthwhile to listen to them?"</p>
<p>"I have heard, Lord, that they do."</p>
<p>"So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline.</p>
<p>"What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis refrain from abducting women and maidens of good families and from detaining them?"</p>
<p>"I have heard, Lord, that they refrain from doing so."</p>
<p>"So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline.</p>
<p>"What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis show respect, honor, esteem, and veneration towards their shrines, both those within the city and those outside it, and do not deprive them of the due offerings as given and made to them formerly?"</p>
<p>"I have heard, Lord, that they do venerate their shrines, and that they do not deprive them of their offerings."</p>
<p>"So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline.</p>
<p>"What have you heard, Ananda: do the Vajjis duly protect and guard the arahats, so that those who have not come to the realm yet might do so, and those who have already come might live there in peace?"</p>
<p>"I have heard, Lord, that they do."</p>
<p>"So long, Ananda, as this is the case, the growth of the Vajjis is to be expected, not their decline."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-5">5.</a> And the Blessed One addressed the brahman Vassakara in these words: "Once, brahman, I dwelt at <a id="vesali">Vesali</a>, at the <a id="sarandada">Sarandada</a> shrine, and there it was that I taught the Vajjis these seven conditions leading to (a nation's) welfare. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5'>[5]</a> So long, brahman, as these endure among the Vajjis, and the Vajjis are known for it, their growth is to be expected, not their decline."</p>
<p>Thereupon the brahman Vassakara spoke thus to the Blessed One: "If the Vajjis, Venerable Gotama, were endowed with only one or another of these conditions leading to welfare, their growth would have to be expected, not their decline. What then of all the seven? No harm, indeed, can be done to the Vajjis in battle by Magadha's king, Ajatasattu, except through treachery or discord. Well, then, Venerable Gotama, we will take our leave, for we have much to perform, much work to do."</p>
<p>"Do as now seems fit to you, brahman." And the brahman Vassakara, the chief minister of Magadha, approving of the Blessed One's words and delighted by them, rose from his seat and departed.</p>


<h2>Welfare of the Bhikkhus</h2>
<p><a id="para-1-6">6.</a> Then, soon after Vassakara's departure, the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: "Go now, Ananda, and assemble in the hall of audience as many bhikkhus as live around Rajagaha."</p>
<p>"Very well, Lord." And the Venerable Ananda did as he was requested and informed the Blessed One: "The community of bhikkhus is assembled, Lord. Now let the Blessed One do as he wishes."</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One rose from his seat, went up to the hall of audience, took his appointed seat there, and addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Seven conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth, bhikkhus. Listen and pay heed to what I shall say."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord."</p>
<p>"The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected, not their decline, bhikkhus, so long as they assemble frequently and in large numbers; meet and disperse peacefully and attend to the affairs of the Sangha in concord; so long as they appoint no new rules, and do not abolish the existing ones, but proceed in accordance with the code of training (Vinaya) laid down; so long as they show respect, honor, esteem, and veneration towards the elder bhikkhus, those of long standing, long gone forth, the fathers and leaders of the Sangha, and think it worthwhile to listen to them; so long as they do not come under the power of the craving that leads to fresh becoming; so long as they cherish the forest depths for their dwellings; so long as they establish themselves in mindfulness, so that virtuous brethren of the Order who have not come yet might do so, and those already come might live in peace; so long, bhikkhus, as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it, their growth is to be expected, not their decline.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-7">7.</a> "Seven further conditions leading to welfare I shall set forth, bhikkhus. Listen and pay heed to what I shall say."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord."</p>
<p>"The growth of the bhikkhus is to be expected, not their decline, bhikkhus, so long as they do not delight in, are not pleased with, and are not fond of activities, talk, sleep, and company; so long as they do not harbor, do not come under the spell of evil desires; have no bad friends, associates, or companions; and so long as they do not stop halfway on account of some trifling achievement. So long, bhikkhus, as these seven conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus and the bhikkhus are known for it, their growth is to be expected, not their decline.</p>

So long, bhikkhus, as these six conditions leading to welfare endure among the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus are known for it, their growth is to be expected, not their decline.</p>

<p><a id="para-1-12">12.</a> And the Blessed One, living at Rajagaha, at the hill called Vultures' Peak, often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p>"Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9' id='fnt-9'>[9]</a> Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10' id='fnt-10'>[10]</a> of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-13">13.</a> When the Blessed One had stayed at Rajagaha as long as he pleased, he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: "Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="ambala">Ambalatthika</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord."</p>
<p>And the Blessed One took up his abode at Ambalatthika, together with a large community of bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-14">14.</a> At Ambalatthika the Blessed One came to stay in the king's rest house; and there, too, the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p>"Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-15">15.</a> When the Blessed One had stayed at Ambalatthika as long as he pleased, he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: "Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="nalanda">Nalanda</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord."</p>
<p>And the Blessed One took up his abode at Nalanda together with a large community of bhikkhus, and came to stay in the mango grove of <a id="pavarika">Pavarika</a>.</p>


<h2>Sariputta's Lion's Roar <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-11' id='fnt-11'>[11]</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-1-16">16.</a> Then the <a id="sarip">Venerable Sariputta</a> went to the Blessed One, respectfully greeted him, sat down at one side, and spoke thus to him:</p>
<p>"This faith, Lord, I have in the Blessed One, that there has not been, there will not be, nor is there now, another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed One."</p>
<p>"Lofty indeed is this speech of yours, Sariputta, and lordly! A bold utterance, a veritable sounding of the lion's roar! But how is this, Sariputta? Those Arahants, Fully Enlightened Ones of the past &mdash; do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones, as to their virtue, their meditation, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-12' id='fnt-12'>[12]</a> their wisdom, their abiding, and their emancipation?" <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-13' id='fnt-13'>[13]</a></p>
<p>"Not so, Lord."</p>
<p>"Then how is this, Sariputta? Those Arahants, Fully Enlightened Ones of the future &mdash; do you have direct personal knowledge of all those Blessed Ones, as to their virtue, their meditation, their wisdom, their abiding, and their emancipation?"</p>
<p>"Not so, Lord."</p>
<p>"Then how is this, Sariputta? Of me, who am at present the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One, do you have direct personal knowledge as to my virtue, my meditation, my wisdom, my abiding, and my emancipation?"</p>
<p>"Not so, Lord."</p>
<p>"Then it is clear, Sariputta, that you have no such direct personal knowledge of the Arahats, the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past, the future, and the present. How then dare you set forth a speech so lofty and lordly, an utterance so bold, a veritable sounding of the lion's roar, saying: 'This faith, Lord, I have in the Blessed One, that there has not been, there will not be, nor is there now another recluse or brahman more exalted in Enlightenment than the Blessed One'?"</p>
<p><a id="para-1-17">17.</a> "No such direct personal knowledge, indeed, is mine, Lord, of the Arahants, the Fully Enlightened Ones of the past, the future, and the present; and yet I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma. Suppose, Lord, a king's frontier fortress was strongly fortified, with strong ramparts and turrets, and it had a single gate, and there was a gatekeeper, intelligent, experienced, and prudent, who would keep out the stranger but allow the friend to enter. As he patrols the path that leads all around the fortress, he does not perceive a hole or fissure in the ramparts even big enough to allow a cat to slip through. So he comes to the conclusion: 'Whatever grosser living things are to enter or leave this city, they will all have to do so just by this gate.' In the same way, Lord, I have come to know the lawfulness of the Dhamma.</p>
<p>"For, Lord, all the Blessed Ones, Arahants, Fully Enlightened Ones of the past had abandoned the five hindrances, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-14' id='fnt-14'>[14]</a> the mental defilements that weaken wisdom; had well established their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness; <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-15' id='fnt-15'>[15]</a> had duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment, and were fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment.</p>
<p>"And, Lord, all the Blessed Ones, Arahants, Fully Enlightened Ones of the future will abandon the five hindrances, the mental defilements that weaken wisdom; will well establish their minds in the four foundations of mindfulness; will duly cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment, and will be fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment.</p>
<p>"And the Blessed One too, Lord, being at present the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One, has abandoned the five hindrances, the mental defilements that weaken wisdom; has well established his mind in the four foundations of mindfulness; has duly cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment, and is fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-18">18.</a> And also in Nalanda, in the mango grove of Pavarika, the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p>"Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-19">19.</a> When the Blessed One had stayed at Nalanda as long as he pleased, he addressed the Venerable Ananda thus:</p>
<p>"Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="pataligama">Pataligama</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord."</p>
<p>And the Blessed One took up his abode at Pataligama together with a large community of bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-20">20.</a> Then the devotees of Pataligama came to know: "The Blessed One, they say, has arrived at Pataligama." And they approached the Blessed One, respectfully greeted him, sat down at one side, and addressed him thus: "May the Blessed One, Lord, kindly visit our council hall." And the Blessed One consented by his silence.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-21">21.</a> Knowing the Blessed One's consent, the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats, respectfully saluted him, and keeping their right sides towards him, departed for the council hall. Then they prepared the council hall by covering the floor all over, arranging seats and water, and setting out an oil lamp. Having done this, they returned to the Blessed One, respectfully greeted him, and standing at one side, announced: "Lord, the council hall is ready, with the floor covered all over, seats and water prepared, and an oil lamp has been set out. Let the Blessed One come, Lord, at his convenience.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-22">22.</a> And the Blessed One got ready, and taking his bowl and robe, went to the council hall together with the company of bhikkhus. After rinsing his feet, the Blessed One entered the council hall and took his seat close to the middle pillar, facing east. The community of bhikkhus, after rinsing their feet, also entered the council hall and took seats near the western wall, facing east, so that the Blessed One was before them. And the devotees of Pataligama, after rinsing their feet and entering the council hall, sat down near the eastern wall, facing west, so that the Blessed One was in front of them.</p>


<h2>The Fruits of an Immoral and a Moral Life</h2>
<p><a id="para-1-23">23.</a> Thereupon the Blessed One addressed the devotees of Pataligama thus: "The immoral man, householders, by falling away from virtue, encounters five perils: great loss of wealth through heedlessness; an evil reputation; a timid and troubled demeanor in every society, be it that of nobles, brahmans, householders, or ascetics; death in bewilderment; and, at the breaking up of the body after death, rebirth in a realm of misery, in an unhappy state, in the nether world, in hell.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-24">24.</a> "Five blessings, householders, accrue to the righteous man through his practice of virtue: great increase of wealth through his diligence; a favorable reputation; a confident deportment, without timidity, in every society, be it that of nobles, brahmans, householders, or ascetics; a serene death; and, at the breaking up of the body after death, rebirth in a happy state, in a heavenly world."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-25">25.</a> And the Blessed One spent much of the night instructing the devotees of Pataligama in the Dhamma, rousing, edifying, and gladdening them, after which he dismissed them, saying: "The night is far advanced, householders. You may go at your convenience.</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the devotees of Pataligama rose from their seats, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and keeping their right sides towards him, departed. And the Blessed One, soon after their departure, retired into privacy.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-26">26.</a> At that time <a id="sunidha">Sunidha</a> and Vassakara, the chief ministers of Magadha, were building a fortress at Pataligama in defense against the Vajjis. And deities in large numbers, counted in thousands, had taken possession of sites at Pataligama. In the region where deities of great power prevailed, officials of great power were bent on constructing edifices; and where deities of medium power and lesser power prevailed, officials of medium and lesser power were bent on constructing edifices.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-27">27.</a> And the Blessed One saw with the heavenly eye, pure and transcending the faculty of men, the deities, counted in thousands, where they had taken possession of sites in Pataligama. And rising before the night was spent, towards dawn, the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda thus: "Who is it, Ananda, that is erecting a city at Pataligama?"</p>
<p>"Sunidha and Vassakara, Lord, the chief ministers of Magadha, are building a fortress at Pataligama, in defence against the Vajjis."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-28">28.</a> "It is, Ananda, as if Sunidha and Vassakara had taken counsel with the gods of the Thirty-three. For I beheld, Ananda, with the heavenly eye, pure and transcending the faculty of men, a large number of deities, counted in thousands, that have taken possession of sites at Pataligama. In the region where deities of great power prevail, officials of great power are bent on constructing edifices; and where deities of medium and lesser power prevail, officials of medium and lesser power are bent on constructing edifices. Truly, Ananda, as far as the Aryan race extends and trade routes spread, this will be the foremost city <a id="pataliputta">Pataliputta</a>, a trade-center. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-16' id='fnt-16'>[16]</a> But Pataliputta, Ananda, will be assailed by three perils &mdash; fire, water, and dissension."</p>
<p><a id="para-1-29">29.</a> Then Sunidha and Vassakara went to the Blessed One, and after courteous greeting to the Blessed One, and exchanging many pleasant words, they stood at one side and addressed him thus: "May the Venerable Gotama please accept our invitation for tomorrow's meal, together with the community of bhikkhus." And the Blessed One consented by his silence.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-30">30.</a> Knowing the Blessed One's consent, Sunidha and Vassakara departed for their own abodes, where they had choice food, hard and soft, prepared. And when it was time, they announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, Venerable Gotama; the meal is ready."</p>
<p>Thereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon, and taking bowl and robe, he went together with the community of bhikkhus to the abode of Sunidha and Vassakara, where he took the seat prepared for him. And Sunidha and Vassakara themselves attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, and served them with choice food, hard and soft. When the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from the bowl, they took low seats and sat down at one side.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-31">31.</a> And the Blessed One thanked them with these stanzas:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
Wherever he may dwell, the prudent man
Ministers to the chaste and virtuous;
And having to these worthy ones made gifts,
He shares his merits with the local devas.

And so revered, they honor him in turn,
Are gracious to him even as a mother
Is towards her own, her only son;
And he who thus enjoys the devas' grace,
And is by them beloved, good fortune sees.
</div>
<p>After this, the Blessed One rose from his seat and departed.</p>


<h2>Crossing the Ganges</h2>
<p><a id="para-1-32">32.</a> Then Sunidha and Vassakara followed behind the Blessed One, step by step, saying: "Through whichever gate the recluse Gotama will depart today, that we will name the Gotama-gate; and the ford by which he will cross the river Ganges shall be named the Gotama-ford." And so it came to pass, where the gate was concerned.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-33">33.</a> But when the Blessed One came to the river <a id="ganges">Ganges</a>, it was full to the brim, so that crows could drink from it. And some people went in search of a boat or float, while others tied up a raft, because they desired to get across. But the Blessed One, as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or draw in his outstretched arm, vanished from this side of the river Ganges, and came to stand on the yonder side.</p>
<p><a id="para-1-34">34.</a> And the Blessed One saw the people who desired to cross searching for a boat or float, while others were binding rafts. And then the Blessed One, seeing them thus, gave forth the solemn utterance:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
They who have bridged the ocean vast,
Leaving the lowlands far behind,
While others still their frail rafts bind,
Are saved by wisdom unsurpassed.

<h2>The Four Noble Truths</h2>
<p><a id="para-2-1">1.</a> Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="kotigama">Kotigama</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode at Kotigama together with a large community of bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-2">2.</a> And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus, it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you. What are these four? They are the noble truth of suffering; the noble truth of the origin of suffering; the noble truth of the cessation of suffering; and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of suffering. But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming, and there is no fresh becoming."</p>
<p><a id="para-2-3">3.</a> Thus it was said by the Blessed One. And the Happy One, the Master, further said:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
Through not seeing the Four Noble Truths,
Long was the weary path from birth to birth.
When these are known, removed is rebirth's cause,
The root of sorrow plucked; then ends rebirth.
</div>
<p><a id="para-2-4">4.</a> And also at Kotigama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: "Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-2-5">5.</a> When the Blessed One had stayed at Kotigama as long as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="nadika">Nadika</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode in Nadika together with a large community of bhikkhus, staying in the Brick House.</p>

<h2><a id="spec4">The Four Specific Attainments</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-2-6">6.</a> Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One and, after greeting him respectfully, sat down at one side. And he said to the Blessed One: "Here in Nadika, Lord, there have passed away the bhikkhu <a id="salha">Salha</a> and the bhikkhuni <a id="nanda">Nanda</a>. Likewise there have passed away the layman <a id="sudatta">Sudatta</a> and the laywoman <a id="sujata">Sujata</a>; likewise the layman <a id="kakudha">Kakudha</a>, <a id="kalinga">Kalinga</a>, <a id="nikata">Nikata</a>, <a id="katissabha">Katissabha</a>, <a id="tuttha">Tuttha</a>, <a id="santuttha">Santuttha</a>, <a id="bhadda">Bhadda</a>, and <a id="laysubhadda">Subhadda</a>. What is their destiny, Lord? What is their future state?"</p>
<p><a id="para-2-7">7.</a> "The bhikkhu Salha, Ananda, through the destruction of the taints in this very lifetime has attained to the taint-free deliverance of mind and deliverance through wisdom, having directly known and realized it by himself. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-17' id='fnt-17'>[17]</a></p>
<p>"The bhikkhuni Nanda, Ananda, through the destruction of the five lower fetters (that bind beings to the world of the senses), has arisen spontaneously (among the Suddhavasa deities) and will come to final cessation in that very place, not liable to return from that world.</p>
<p>"The layman Sudatta, Ananda, through the destruction of the three fetters (self-belief, doubt, and faith in the efficacy of rituals and observances), and the lessening of lust, hatred, and delusion, has become a once-returner and is bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this world.</p>
<p>"The laywoman Sujata, Ananda, through the destruction of the three fetters has become a stream-enterer, and is safe from falling into the states of misery, assured, and bound for Enlightenment.</p>
<p>"The layman Kakudha, Ananda, through the destruction of the five lower fetters (that bind beings to the world of the senses), has arisen spontaneously (among the Suddhavasa deities), and will come to final cessation in that very place, not liable to return from that world.</p>
<p>"So it is with Kalinga, Nikata, Katissabha, Tuttha, Santuttha, Bhadda, and Subhadda, and with more than fifty laymen in Nadika. More than ninety laymen who have passed away in Nadika, Ananda, through the destruction of the three fetters, and the lessening of lust, hatred, and delusion, have become once-returners and are bound to make an end of suffering after having returned but once more to this world.</p>
<p>"More than five hundred laymen who have passed away in Nadika, Ananda, through the complete destruction of the three fetters have become stream-enterers, and are safe from falling into the states of misery, assured, and bound for Enlightenment.</p>

<h2>The Mirror of the Dhamma</h2>
<p><a id="para-2-8">8.</a> "<a id="mirror">But truly</a>, Ananda, it is nothing strange that human beings should die. But if each time it happens you should come to the Tathagata and ask about them in this manner, indeed it would be troublesome to him. Therefore, Ananda, I will give you the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma, possessing which the noble disciple, should he so desire, can declare of himself: 'There is no more rebirth for me in hell, nor as an animal or ghost, nor in any realm of woe. A stream-enterer am I, safe from falling into the states of misery, assured am I and bound for Enlightenment.'"</p>
<p><a id="para-2-9">9.</a> "And what, Ananda, is that teaching called the Mirror of Dhamma, possessing which the noble disciple may thus declare of himself?</p>
<p>"In this case, Ananda, the noble disciple possesses unwavering faith in the Buddha thus: 'The Blessed One is an Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, the Happy One, the knower of the world, the paramount trainer of beings, the teacher of gods and men, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.'</p>
<p>"He possesses unwavering faith in the Dhamma thus: 'Well propounded by the Blessed One is the Dhamma, evident, timeless, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-18' id='fnt-18'>[18]</a> inviting investigation, leading to emancipation, to be comprehended by the wise, each for himself.'</p>
<p>"He possesses unwavering faith in the Blessed One's Order of Disciples thus: 'Well faring is the Blessed One's Order of Disciples, righteously, wisely, and dutifully: that is to say, the four pairs of men, the eight classes of persons. The Blessed One's Order of Disciples is worthy of honor, of hospitality, of offerings, of veneration &mdash; the supreme field for meritorious deeds in the world.'</p>
<p>"And he possesses virtues that are dear to the Noble Ones, complete and perfect, spotless and pure, which are liberating, praised by the wise, uninfluenced (by worldly concerns), and favorable to concentration of mind.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-10">10.</a> "This, Ananda, is the teaching called the Mirror of the Dhamma, whereby the noble disciple may thus know of himself: 'There is no more rebirth for me in hell, nor as an animal or ghost, nor in any realm of woe. A stream-enterer am I, safe from falling into the states of misery, assured am I and bound for Enlightenment.'"</p>
<p><a id="para-2-11">11.</a> And also in Nadika, in the Brick House, the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: "Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-2-12">12.</a> When the Blessed One had stayed in Nadika as long as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Come, Ananda, let us go to Vesali."</p>
<p>"So be it, O Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode in Vesali together with a large community of bhikkhus, and stayed in Ambapali's grove.</p>

<h2>Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension</h2>
<p><a id="para-2-13">13.</a> Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Mindful should you dwell, bhikkhus, clearly comprehending; thus I exhort you.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-14">14.</a> "And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu mindful? When he dwells contemplating the body in the body, earnestly, clearly comprehending, and mindfully, after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world; and when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, the mind in the mind, and mental objects in mental objects, earnestly, clearly comprehending, and mindfully, after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world, then is he said to be mindful.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-15">15.</a> "And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu have clear comprehension? When he remains fully aware of his coming and going, his looking forward and his looking away, his bending and stretching, his wearing of his robe and carrying of his bowl, his eating and drinking, masticating and savoring, his defecating and urinating, his walking, standing, sitting, lying down, going to sleep or keeping awake, his speaking or being silent, then is he said to have clear comprehension.</p>
<p>"Mindful should you dwell, bhikkhus, clearly comprehending; thus I exhort you."</p>

<h2>Ambapali and the Licchavis</h2>
<p><a id="section-2-16">16</a>. Then <a id="ambapali">Ambapali</a> the courtesan came to know: "The Blessed One, they say, has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in my Mango Grove." And she ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready, mounted one of them herself, and accompanied by the rest, drove out from Vesali towards her park. She went by carriage as far as the carriage could go, then alighted; and approaching the Blessed One on foot, she respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side. And the Blessed One instructed Ambapali the courtesan in the Dhamma and roused, edified, and gladdened her.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-17">17.</a> Thereafter Ambapali the courtesan spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "May the Blessed One, O Lord, please accept my invitation for tomorrow's meal, together with the community of bhikkhus." And by his silence the Blessed One consented.</p>
<p>Sure, then, of the Blessed One's consent, Ambapali the courtesan rose from her seat, respectfully saluted him, and keeping her right side towards him, took her departure.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-18">18.</a> Then the <a id="licchavis">Licchavi</a> of Vesali came to know: "The Blessed One, they say, has arrived at Vesali and is now staying in Ambapali's grove." And they ordered a large number of magnificent carriages to be made ready, each mounted one, and accompanied by the rest, drove out from Vesali. Now, of these Licchavis, some were in blue, with clothing and ornaments all of blue, while others were in yellow, red, and white.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-19">19.</a> And it so happened that Ambapali the courtesan drove up against the young Licchavis, axle by axle, wheel by wheel, and yoke by yoke. Thereupon the Licchavis exclaimed: "Why do you drive up against us in this fashion, Ambapali?"</p>
<p>"Thus it is, indeed, my princes, and not otherwise! For the Blessed One is invited by me for tomorrow's meal, together with the community of bhikkhus!"</p>
<p>"Give up the meal, Ambapali, for a hundred thousand!"</p>
<p>But she replied: "Even if you were to give me Vesali, sirs, together with its tributary lands, I would not give up a meal of such importance."</p>
<p>Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance: "See, friends! We are defeated by this mango lass! We are utterly outdone by this mango lass!" But they continued on their way to Ambapali's grove.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-20">20.</a> And the Blessed One beheld the Licchavis from afar, as they drove up. Then he spoke to the bhikkhus, saying: "Those of you, bhikkhus, who have not yet seen the Thirty-three gods, may behold the assembly of the Licchavis, and may gaze on them, for they are comparable to the assembly of the Thirty-three gods."</p>
<p><a id="para-2-21">21.</a> Then the Licchavis drove their carriages as far as the carriages could go, then alighted; and approaching the Blessed One on foot, they respectfully greeted him and sat down at one side. The Blessed One instructed the Licchavis in the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened them.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-22">22.</a> Thereafter the Licchavis spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "May the Blessed One, O Lord, please accept our invitation for tomorrow's meal, together with the community of bhikkhus."</p>
<p>"The invitation for tomorrow's meal, Licchavis, has been accepted by me from Ambapali the courtesan."</p>
<p>Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers in annoyance: "See, friends! We are defeated by this mango lass! We are utterly outdone by this mango lass!" And then the Licchavis, approving of the Blessed One's words and delighted with them, rose from their seats, respectfully saluted him, and keeping their right sides towards him, took their departure.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-23">23.</a> Then, after the night had passed, Ambapali the courtesan had choice food, hard and soft, prepared in her park, and announced it to the Blessed One: "It is time, O Lord; the meal is ready." Thereupon the Blessed One got ready in the forenoon, and taking bowl and robe, he went together with the community of bhikkhus to Ambapali's dwelling, and there he took the seat prepared for him. And Ambapali herself attended on the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, and served them with choice food, hard and soft.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-24">24.</a> And when the Blessed One had finished his meal and had removed his hand from his bowl, Ambapali the courtesan took a low seat, and placing herself at one side, spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "This park, O Lord, I offer to the community of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha." And the Blessed One accepted the park. He then instructed Ambapali in the Dhamma, and having roused, edified, and gladdened her, he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-25">25.</a> And also at Vesali, in Ambapali's grove, the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: "Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-2-26">26.</a> When the Blessed One had stayed in Ambapali's grove as long as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Come, Ananda, let us go to the village of <a id="beluva">Beluva</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode in the village of Beluva together with a large community of bhikkhus.</p>

<h2>The Blessed One's Deadly Sickness</h2>
<p><a id="para-2-27">27.</a> At that time the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus, saying: "Go now, bhikkhus, and seek shelter anywhere in the neighborhood of Vesali where you are welcome, among acquaintances and friends, and there spend the rainy season. As for me, I shall spend the rainy season in this very place, in the village of Beluva."</p>
<p>"So be it, O Lord," the bhikkhus said.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-28">28.</a> <a id="illness">But when</a> the Blessed One had entered upon the rainy season, there arose in him a severe illness, and sharp and deadly pains came upon him. And the Blessed One endured them mindfully, clearly comprehending and unperturbed.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-29">29.</a> Then it occurred to the Blessed One: "It would not be fitting if I came to my final passing away without addressing those who attended on me, without taking leave of the community of bhikkhus. Then let me suppress this illness by strength of will, resolve to maintain the life process, and live on."</p>
<p><a id="para-2-30">30.</a> And the Blessed One suppressed the illness by strength of will, resolved to maintain the life process, and lived on. So it came about that the Blessed One's illness was allayed.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-31">31.</a> And the Blessed One recovered from that illness; and soon after his recovery he came out from his dwelling place and sat down in the shade of the building, on a seat prepared for him. Then the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, respectfully greeted him, and sitting down at one side, he spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "Fortunate it is for me, O Lord, to see the Blessed One at ease again! Fortunate it is for me, O Lord, to see the Blessed One recovered! For truly, Lord, when I saw the Blessed One's sickness it was as though my own body became weak as a creeper, every thing around became dim to me, and my senses failed me. Yet, Lord, I still had some little comfort in the thought that the Blessed One would not come to his final passing away until he had given some last instructions respecting the community of bhikkhus."</p>
<p><a id="fist"></a>32. Thus spoke the Venerable Ananda, but the Blessed One answered him, saying: "What more does the community of bhikkhus expect from me, Ananda? I have set forth the Dhamma without making any distinction of esoteric and exoteric doctrine; there is nothing, Ananda, with regard to the teachings that the Tathagata holds to the last with the closed fist of a teacher who keeps some things back. Whosoever may think that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus, or that the community depends upon him, it is such a one that would have to give last instructions respecting them. But, Ananda, the Tathagata has no such idea as that it is he who should lead the community of bhikkhus, or that the community depends upon him. So what instructions should he have to give respecting the community of bhikkhus?</p>
<p>"Now I am frail, Ananda, old, aged, far gone in years. This is my eightieth year, and my life is spent. Even as an old cart, Ananda, is held together with much difficulty, so the body of the Tathagata is kept going only with supports. It is, Ananda, only when the Tathagata, disregarding external objects, with the cessation of certain feelings, attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-19' id='fnt-19'>[19]</a> that his body is more comfortable.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-33">33.</a> "<a id="island">Therefore</a>, Ananda, be islands unto yourselves, refuges unto yourselves, seeking no external refuge; with the Dhamma as your island, the Dhamma as your refuge, seeking no other refuge.</p>
<p>"And how, Ananda, is a bhikkhu an island unto himself, a refuge unto himself, seeking no external refuge; with the Dhamma as his island, the Dhamma as his refuge, seeking no other refuge?</p>
<p><a id="para-2-34">34.</a> "When he dwells contemplating the body in the body, earnestly, clearly comprehending, and mindfully, after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world; when he dwells contemplating feelings in feelings, the mind in the mind, and mental objects in mental objects, earnestly, clearly comprehending, and mindfully, after having overcome desire and sorrow in regard to the world, then, truly, he is an island unto himself, a refuge unto himself, seeking no external refuge; having the Dhamma as his island, the Dhamma as his refuge, seeking no other refuge.</p>
<p><a id="para-2-35">35.</a> "Those bhikkhus of mine, Ananda, who now or after I am gone, abide as an island unto themselves, as a refuge unto themselves, seeking no other refuge; having the Dhamma as their island and refuge, seeking no other refuge: it is they who will become the highest, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20' id='fnt-20'>[20]</a> if they have the desire to learn."</p>

<h1><a id='chap3'>Part Three: Relinquishing the Will to Live</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>

<h2>The Blessed One's Prompting</h2>
<p><a id="para-3-1">1.</a> Then the Blessed One, getting ready in the forenoon, took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for alms. After the alms round and meal, on his return, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Take up a mat, Ananda, and let us spend the day at the Capala shrine."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Venerable Ananda took up a mat and followed behind the Blessed One, step by step.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-2">2.</a> And the Blessed One went to the Capala shrine and sat down on the seat prepared for him. And when the Venerable Ananda had seated himself at one side after he had respectfully saluted the Blessed One, the Lord said to him: "Pleasant, Ananda, is Vesali; pleasant are the shrines of <a id="udena">Udena</a>, <a id="gotamaka">Gotamaka</a>, <a id="sattambaka">Sattambaka</a>, <a id="bahuputta">Bahuputta</a>, Sarandada, and <a id="capala">Capala</a>."</p>
<p><a id="para-3-3">3.</a> And the Blessed One said: "Whosoever, Ananda, has developed, practiced, employed, strengthened, maintained, scrutinized, and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-21' id='fnt-21'>[21]</a> The Tathagata, Ananda, has done so. Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it."</p>
<p><a id="para-3-4">4.</a> But the Venerable Ananda was unable to grasp the plain suggestion, the significant prompting, given by the Blessed One. As though his mind was influenced by Mara, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-22' id='fnt-22'>[22]</a> he did not beseech the Blessed One: "May the Blessed One remain, O Lord!. May the Happy One remain, O Lord, throughout the world-period, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men!"</p>
<p><a id="para-3-5">5.</a> And when for a second and a third time the Blessed One repeated his words, the Venerable Ananda remained silent.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-6">6.</a> Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Ananda: "Go now, Ananda, and do as seems fit to you."</p>
<p>"Even so, O Lord." And the Venerable Ananda, rising from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and keeping his right side towards him, took his seat under a tree some distance away.</p>

<h2>Mara's Appeal</h2>
<p><a id="para-3-7">7.</a> <a id="mara">And when</a> the Venerable Ananda had gone away, Mara, the Evil One, approached the Blessed One. And standing at one side he spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "Now, O Lord, let the Blessed One come to his final passing away; let the Happy One utterly pass away! The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord.</p>
<p>"For the Blessed One, O Lord, spoke these words to me: 'I shall not come to my final passing away, Evil One, until my bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen, have come to be true disciples &mdash; wise, well disciplined, apt and learned, preservers of the Dhamma, living according to the Dhamma, abiding by the appropriate conduct, and having learned the Master's word, are able to expound it, preach it, proclaim it, establish it, reveal it, explain it in detail, and make it clear; until, when adverse opinions arise, they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well, and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma.' <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-23' id='fnt-23'>[23]</a></p>
<p><a id="para-3-8">8.</a> "And now, O Lord, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen, have become the Blessed One's disciples in just this way. So, O Lord, let the Blessed One come to his final passing away! The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord.</p>
<p>"For the Blessed One, O Lord, spoke these words to me: 'I shall not come to my final passing away, Evil One, until this holy life taught by me has become successful, prosperous, far-renowned, popular, and widespread, until it is well proclaimed among gods and men.' And this too has come to pass in just this way. So, O Lord, let the Blessed One come to his final passing away, let the Happy One utterly pass away! The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord."</p>

<h2>The Blessed One Relinquishes His Will to Live</h2>
<p><a id="para-3-9">9.</a> When this was said, the Blessed One spoke to Mara, the Evil One, saying: "Do not trouble yourself, Evil One. Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about. Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away."</p>
<p><a id="section-3-10">10</a>. And at the Capala shrine the Blessed One thus mindfully and clearly comprehending renounced his will to live on. And upon the Lord's renouncing his will to live on, there came a tremendous earthquake, dreadful and astonishing, and thunder rolled across the heavens. And the Blessed One beheld it with understanding, and made this solemn utterance:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
What causes life, unbounded or confined <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-24' id='fnt-24'>[24]</a>  &mdash;
His process of becoming <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-25' id='fnt-25'>[25]</a>  &mdash;  this the Sage
Renounces. With inward calm and joy he breaks,
As though a coat of mail, his own life's cause. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-26' id='fnt-26'>[26]</a> 
</div>
<p><a id="para-3-11">11.</a> Then it came to the mind of the Venerable Ananda: "Marvellous it is indeed, and most wonderful! The earth shakes mightily, tremendously! Dreadful and astonishing it is, how the thunders roll across the heavens! What could be the reason, what the cause, that so mighty an earthquake should arise?"</p>

<h2><a id="eq8">Eight Causes of Earthquakes</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-3-12">12.</a> And the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, and respectfully greeting him, sat down at one side. Then he spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "Marvellous it is indeed, and most wonderful! The earth shakes mightily, tremendously! Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavens! What could be the reason, what the cause, that so mighty an earthquake should arise?"</p>
<p><a id="section-3-13">13</a>. Then the Blessed One said: "There are eight reasons, Ananda, eight causes for a mighty earthquake to arise. What are those eight?</p>
<p><a id="para-3-14">14.</a> "This great earth, Ananda, is established upon liquid, the liquid upon the atmosphere, and the atmosphere upon space. And when, Ananda, mighty atmospheric disturbances take place, the liquid is agitated. And with the agitation of the liquid, tremors of the earth arise. This is the first reason, the first cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-15">15.</a> "Again, Ananda, when an ascetic or holy man of great power, one who has gained mastery of his mind, or a deity who is mighty and potent, develops intense concentration on the delimited aspect of the earth element, and to a boundless degree on the liquid element, he, too, causes the earth to tremble, quiver, and shake. This is the second reason, the second cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-16"></a> 16-21. "Again, Ananda, when the Bodhisatta departs from the Tusita realm and descends into his mother's womb, mindfully and clearly comprehending; and when the Bodhisatta comes out from his mother's womb, mindfully and clearly comprehending; and when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment; when the Tathagata sets rolling the excellent Wheel of the Dhamma; when the Tathagata renounces his will to live on; and when the Tathagata comes to pass away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains &mdash; then, too, Ananda, this great earth trembles, quivers, and shakes.</p>
<p>"These, Ananda, are the eight reasons, the eight causes for a great earthquake to arise. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-27' id='fnt-27'>[27]</a></p>

<h2><a id="assem8">Eight Assemblies</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-3-22">22.</a> "Now there are eight kinds of assemblies, Ananda, that is to say, assemblies of nobles, brahmans, householders, ascetics, of the Four Great Kings, of the Thirty-three gods, of Maras, and of Brahmas.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-23">23.</a> "And I recall, Ananda, how I have attended each of these eight kinds of assemblies, amounting to hundreds. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-28' id='fnt-28'>[28]</a> And before seating myself and starting the conversation or the discussion, I made my appearance resemble theirs, my voice resemble theirs. And so I taught them the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened them. Yet while I was speaking to them thus, they did not know me, and they would enquire of one another, asking: 'Who is he that speaks to us? Is it a man or a god?'</p>
<p>"Then having taught them the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened them, I would straightaway vanish. And when I had vanished, too, they did not know me, and they would enquire of one another, asking: 'Who is he that has vanished? Is it a man or a god?'</p>
<p>"And such, Ananda, are the eight kinds of assemblies.</p>

<h2><a id="mas8">Eight Fields of Mastery</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-3-24">24.</a> "Now there are eight fields of mastery, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-29' id='fnt-29'>[29]</a> Ananda. What are those eight?</p>
<p><a id="para-3-25">25.</a> "When one, perceiving forms subjectively, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-30' id='fnt-30'>[30]</a> sees small forms, beautiful or ugly, external to himself, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-31' id='fnt-31'>[31]</a> and mastering them, is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are &mdash; this is the first field of mastery.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-26">26.</a> "When one, perceiving forms subjectively, sees large forms, beautiful or ugly, external to himself, and mastering them, is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are &mdash; this is the second field of mastery.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-27">27.</a> "When one, not perceiving forms subjectively, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-32' id='fnt-32'>[32]</a> sees small forms, beautiful or ugly, external to himself, and mastering them, is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are &mdash; this is the third field of mastery.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-28">28.</a> "When one, not perceiving forms subjectively, sees large forms, beautiful or ugly, external to himself, and mastering them, is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are &mdash; this is the fourth field of mastery.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-29">29.</a> "When one, not perceiving forms subjectively, sees forms external to himself that are blue, blue in color, of a blue luster like the blossoms of flax, or like fine Benares muslin which, burnished on both sides, is blue, blue in color, of a blue luster &mdash; when such a one sees forms external to himself that are blue, and mastering them, is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are &mdash; this is the fifth field of mastery.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-30">30.</a> "When one, not perceiving forms subjectively, sees forms external to himself that are yellow, yellow in color, of a yellow luster like the Kanikara blossom, or like fine Benares muslin which, burnished on both sides, is yellow, yellow in color, of a yellow luster &mdash; when such a one sees forms external to himself that are yellow, and mastering them, is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are &mdash; this is the sixth field of mastery.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-31">31.</a> "When one, not perceiving forms subjectively, sees forms external to himself that are red, red in color, of a red luster like the Bandhujivaka blossom, or like fine Benares muslin which, burnished on both sides, is red, red in color, of a red luster &mdash; when such a one sees forms external to himself that are red, and mastering them, is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are &mdash; this is the seventh field of mastery.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-32">32.</a> "When one, not perceiving forms subjectively, sees forms external to himself that are white, white in color, of a white luster like the morning star, or like fine Benares muslin which, burnished on both sides, is white, white in color, of a white luster &mdash; when such a one sees forms external to himself that are white, and mastering them, is aware that he perceives and knows them as they are &mdash; this is the eighth field of mastery.</p>
<p>"These, Ananda, are the eight fields of mastery.</p>

<h2><a id="lib8">Eight Liberations</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-3-33">33.</a> "Now there are eight liberations, Ananda. What are those eight? <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-33' id='fnt-33'>[33]</a></p>
<p><a id="para-3-34">34.</a> "Oneself having form, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-34' id='fnt-34'>[34]</a> one perceives forms; this is the first liberation.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-35">35.</a> "Being unaware of one's own form, one perceives forms external to oneself; this is the second liberation.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-36">36.</a> "Experiencing loveliness, one is intent upon it; <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-35' id='fnt-35'>[35]</a> this is the third liberation.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-37">37.</a> "By utterly transcending the perceptions of matter, by the disappearance of the perceptions of sense-reaction, and by giving no attention to diversity-perceptions, one becomes aware of, attains to, and abides in the sphere of infinite space; this is the fourth liberation.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-38">38.</a> "By utterly transcending the sphere of infinite space, one becomes aware of, attains to, and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness; this is the fifth liberation.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-39">39.</a> "By utterly transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, one becomes aware of, attains to, and abides in the sphere of nothingness; this is the sixth liberation.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-40">40.</a> "By utterly transcending the sphere of nothingness, one attains to and abides in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; this is the seventh liberation.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-41">41.</a> "By utterly transcending the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, one attains to and abides in the cessation of perception and sensation; this is the eighth liberation.</p>
<p>"These, Ananda, are the eight liberations.</p>

<h2>Mara's Former Temptation</h2>
<p><a id="para-3-42">42.</a> "There was a time, Ananda, when I dwelt at Uruvela, on the bank of the Nera&ntilde;jara River, at the foot of the goatherds' banyan-tree, soon after my supreme Enlightenment. And Mara, the Evil One, approached me, saying: 'Now, O Lord, let the Blessed One come to his final passing away! Let the Happy One utterly pass away! The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord.'</p>
<p><a id="para-3-43">43.</a> "Then, Ananda, I answered Mara, the Evil One, saying: 'I shall not come to my final passing away, Evil One, until my bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen, have come to be true disciples &mdash; wise, well disciplined, apt and learned, preservers of the Dhamma, living according to the Dhamma, abiding by appropriate conduct and, having learned the Master's word, are able to expound it, preach it, proclaim it, establish it, reveal it, explain it in detail, and make it clear; until, when adverse opinions arise, they shall be able to refute them thoroughly and well, and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-44">44.</a> "'I shall not come to my final passing away, Evil One, until this holy life taught by me has become successful, prosperous, far-renowned, popular, and widespread, until it is well proclaimed among gods and men.'</p>
<p><a id="para-3-45">45.</a> "And again today, Ananda, at the Capala shrine, Mara, the Evil One, approached me, saying: 'Now, O Lord, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen, have come to be true disciples of the Blessed One &mdash; wise, well disciplined, apt and learned, preservers of the Dhamma, living according to the Dhamma, abiding in the appropriate conduct, and having learned the Master's word, are able to expound it, preach it, proclaim it, establish it, reveal it, explain it in detail, and make it clear; and when adverse opinions arise, they are now able to refute them thoroughly and well, and to preach this convincing and liberating Dhamma.</p>
<p>"'And now, O Lord, this holy life taught by the Blessed One has become successful, prosperous, far-renowned, popular and widespread, and it is well proclaimed among gods and men. Therefore, O Lord, let the Blessed One come to his final passing away! Let the Happy One utterly pass away! The time has come for the Parinibbana of the Lord.'</p>
<p><a id="para-3-46">46.</a> "And then, Ananda, I answered Mara, the Evil One, saying: 'Do not trouble yourself, Evil One. Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about. Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away.'</p>
<p><a id="para-3-47">47.</a> "And in this way, Ananda, today at the Capala shrine the Tathagata has renounced his will to live on."</p>

<h2>Ananda's Appeal</h2>
<p><a id="para-3-48">48.</a> At these words the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "May the Blessed One remain, O Lord! May the Happy One remain, O Lord, throughout the world-period, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men!"</p>
<p><a id="para-3-49">49.</a> And the Blessed One answered, saying: "Enough, Ananda. Do not entreat the Tathagata, for the time is past, Ananda, for such an entreaty."</p>
<p><a id="para-3-50">50-51.</a>  But for a second and a third time, the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "May the Blessed One remain, O Lord! May the Happy One remain, O Lord, throughout the world-period, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men!"</p>
<p><a id="para-3-52">52.</a> Then the Blessed One said: "Do you have faith, Ananda, in the Enlightenment of the Tathagata?" And the Venerable Ananda replied: "Yes, O Lord, I do."</p>
<p>"Then how, Ananda, can you persist against the Tathagata even up to the third time?"</p>
<p><a id="para-3-53">53.</a> Then the Venerable Ananda said: "This, O Lord, I have heard and learned from the Blessed One himself when the Blessed One said to me: 'Whosoever, Ananda, has developed, practiced, employed, strengthened, maintained, scrutinized, and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it. The Tathagata, Ananda, has done so. Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.'"</p>
<p><a id="para-3-54">54.</a> "And did you believe it, Ananda?"</p>
<p>"Yes, O Lord, I did."</p>
<p>"Then, Ananda, the fault is yours. Herein have you failed, inasmuch as you were unable to grasp the plain suggestion, the significant prompting given by the Tathagata, and you did not then entreat the Tathagata to remain. For if you had done so, Ananda, twice the Tathagata might have declined, but the third time he would have consented. Therefore, Ananda, the fault is yours; herein have you failed.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-55">55.</a> "At Rajagaha, Ananda, when dwelling at Vultures' Peak, I spoke to you, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Rajagaha; pleasant is Vultures' Peak. Whosoever, Ananda, has developed... Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.'</p>
<p><a id="para-3-56">56.</a> "So also at the Banyan Grove, at Robbers' Cliff, at the <a id="sattapanni">Sattapanni</a> Cave on the <a id="vebhara">Vebhara</a> Mountain, at the Black Rock of <a id="isigili">Isigili</a>, at the Serpents' Pool in the Cool Forest, at the <a id="tapoda">Tapoda</a> Grove, at the Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels' Feeding-ground, at Jivaka's Mango Grove, and at Small Nook in the Deer Park I spoke to you in the same words, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Rajagaha, pleasant are these places. Whosoever, Ananda, has developed... Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.'</p>
<p>"But you, Ananda, were unable to grasp the plain suggestion, the significant prompting given you by the Tathagata, and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remain. For if you had done so, Ananda, twice the Tathagata might have declined, but the third time he would have consented. Therefore, Ananda, the fault is yours; herein you have failed.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-57">57.</a> "So also at Vesali, Ananda, at different times the Tathagata has spoken to you, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Vesali; pleasant are the shrines of Udena, Gotamaka, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Sarandada, and Capala. Whosoever, Ananda, has developed... Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.'</p>
<p>"But you, Ananda, were unable to grasp the plain suggestion, the significant prompting, given you by the Tathagata, and you did not entreat the Tathagata to remain. For if you had done so, Ananda, twice the Tathagata might have declined, but the third time he would have consented. Therefore, Ananda, the fault is yours; herein you have failed.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-58">58.</a> "Yet, Ananda, have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change, separation, and severance? Of that which is born, come into being, is compounded and subject to decay, how can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution!' There can be no such state of things. And of that, Ananda, which the Tathagata has finished with, that which he has relinquished, given up, abandoned, and rejected &mdash; his will to live on &mdash; the Tathagata's word has been spoken once for all: 'Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about. Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away.' And that the Tathagata should withdraw his words for the sake of living on &mdash; this is an impossibility.</p>

<h2>The Last Admonition</h2>
<p><a id="para-3-59">59.</a> "So, then, Ananda, let us go to the hall of the Gabled House, in the Great Forest." And the Venerable Ananda replied: "So be it, Lord."</p>
<p><a id="para-3-60">60.</a> Then the Blessed One, with the Venerable Ananda, went to the hall of the Gabled House, in the Great Forest. And there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Go now, Ananda, and assemble in the hall of audience all the bhikkhus who dwell in the neighborhood of Vesali."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Venerable Ananda gathered all the bhikkhus who dwelt in the neighborhood of Vesali, and assembled them in the hall of audience. And then, respectfully saluting the Blessed One, and standing at one side, he said: "The community of bhikkhus is assembled, Lord. Now let the Blessed One do as he wishes."</p>
<p><a id="para-3-61">61.</a> Thereupon the Blessed One entered the hall of audience, and taking the seat prepared for him, he exhorted the bhikkhus, saying: "Now, O bhikkhus, I say to you that these teachings of which I have direct knowledge and which I have made known to you &mdash; these you should thoroughly learn, cultivate, develop, and frequently practice, that the life of purity may be established and may long endure, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men.</p>
<p><a id="para-3-62">62.</a> "And what, bhikkhus, are these teachings? They are the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four constituents of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the Noble Eightfold Path. These, bhikkhus, are the teachings of which I have direct knowledge, which I have made known to you, and which you should thoroughly learn, cultivate, develop, and frequently practice, that the life of purity may be established and may long endure, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men."</p>
<p><a id="para-3-63">63.</a> Then the Blessed One said to the bhikkhus: "So, bhikkhus, I exhort you: All compounded things are subject to vanish. Strive with earnestness. The time of the Tathagata's Parinibbana is near. Three months hence the Tathagata will utterly pass away."</p>
<p><a id="para-3-64">64.</a> And having spoken these words, the Happy One, the Master, spoke again, saying:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
My years are now full ripe, the life span left is short.
Departing, I go hence from you, relying on myself alone.
Be earnest, then, O bhikkhus, be mindful and of virtue pure!

With firm resolve, guard your own mind!
Whoso untiringly pursues the Dhamma and the Discipline
Shall go beyond the round of births and make an end of suffering.

<h1><a id='chap4'>Part Four: The Last Meal</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>

<h2>The Elephant's Look</h2>
<p><a id="para-4-1">1.</a> Then the Blessed One, getting ready in the forenoon, took bowl and robe and went into Vesali for alms. After the alms round and meal, on his return, he looked upon Vesali with the elephant's look, <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-36' id='fnt-36'>[36]</a> and said to the Venerable Ananda: "This, Ananda, is the last time that the Tathagata will look upon Vesali. Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="bhandagama">Bhandagama</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, O Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhandagama together with a large community of bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-2">2.</a> And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus, it is through not realizing, through not penetrating four principles that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you. What are those four? They are: noble virtue, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble emancipation. But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming, and there is no fresh becoming."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-3">3.</a> And having spoken these words, the Happy One, the Master, spoke again, saying:</p>
<p>"Virtue, concentration, wisdom, and emancipation unsurpassed &mdash;</p>
<p>These are the principles realized by Gotama the renowned;</p>
<p>And, knowing them, he, the Buddha, to his monks has taught the Dhamma.</p>
<p>He, the destroyer of suffering, the Master, the Seer, is at peace."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-4">4.</a> And also at Bhandagama the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: "Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-5">5.</a> When the Blessed One had stayed at Bhandagama as long as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda: "Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="hatthigama">Hatthigama</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode at Hatthigama together with a large community of bhikkhus.</p>
<p>And when the Blessed One had stayed at Hatthigama as long as he pleased, he took up his abode at Ambagama, then at Jambugama. And at each of these places the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: "Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-6">6.</a> And when the Blessed One had stayed at Jambugama as long as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda: "Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="bhoganagara">Bhoganagara</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode at Bhoganagara together with a large community of bhikkhus, and stayed in the Ananda shrine.</p>

<h2><a id="ref4">The Four Great References</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-4-7">7.</a> And there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Now, bhikkhus, I shall make known to you the four great references. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-37' id='fnt-37'>[37]</a> Listen and pay heed to my words." And those bhikkhus answered, saying:</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-8">8-11</a>. Then the Blessed One said: "In this fashion, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might speak: 'Face to face with the Blessed One, brethren, I have heard and learned thus: This is the Dhamma and the Discipline, the Master's Dispensation'; or: 'In an abode of such and such a name lives a community with elders and a chief. Face to face with that community, I have heard and learned thus: This is the Dhamma and the Discipline, the Master's Dispensation'; or: 'In an abode of such and such a name live several bhikkhus who are elders, who are learned, who have accomplished their course, who are preservers of the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the Summaries. Face to face with those elders, I have heard and learned thus: This is the Dhamma and the Discipline, the Master's Dispensation'; or: 'In an abode of such and such a name lives a single bhikkhu who is an elder, who is learned, who has accomplished his course, who is a preserver of the Dhamma, the Discipline, and the Summaries. Face to face with that elder, I have heard and learned thus: This is the Dhamma and the Discipline, the Master's Dispensation.'</p>
<p>"In such a case, bhikkhus, the declaration of such a bhikkhu is neither to be received with approval nor with scorn. Without approval and without scorn, but carefully studying the sentences word by word, one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the Discipline. If they are neither traceable in the Discourses nor verifiable by the Discipline, one must conclude thus: 'Certainly, this is not the Blessed One's utterance; this has been misunderstood by that bhikkhu &mdash; or by that community, or by those elders, or by that elder.' In that way, bhikkhus, you should reject it. But if the sentences concerned are traceable in the Discourses and verifiable by the Discipline, then one must conclude thus: 'Certainly, this is the Blessed One's utterance; this has been well understood by that bhikkhu &mdash; or by that community, or by those elders, or by that elder.' And in that way, bhikkhus, you may accept it on the first, second, third, or fourth reference. These, bhikkhus, are the four great references for you to preserve."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-12">12.</a> And also at Bhoganagara, at the Ananda shrine, the Blessed One often gave counsel to the bhikkhus thus: "Such and such is virtue; such and such is concentration; and such and such is wisdom. Great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of concentration when it is fully developed by virtuous conduct; great becomes the fruit, great is the gain of wisdom when it is fully developed by concentration; utterly freed from the taints of lust, becoming, and ignorance is the mind that is fully developed in wisdom."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-13">13.</a> When the Blessed One had stayed at Bhoganagara as long as he pleased, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="pava">Pava</a>."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Blessed One took up his abode at Pava together with a great community of bhikkhus, and stayed in the Mango Grove of Cunda, who was by family a metalworker.</p>

<h2>The Buddha's Last Meal</h2>
<p><a id="para-4-14">14.</a> And <a id="cunda">Cunda</a> the metalworker came to know: "The Blessed One, they say, has arrived at Pava, and is staying in my Mango Grove." And he went to the Blessed One, and having respectfully greeted him, sat down at one side. And the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened him.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-15">15.</a> Then Cunda spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "May the Blessed One, O Lord, please accept my invitation for tomorrow's meal, together with the community of bhikkhus." And by his silence the Blessed One consented.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-16">16.</a> Sure, then, of the Blessed One's consent, Cunda the metalworker rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and keeping his right side towards him, took his departure.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-17">17.</a> And Cunda the metalworker, after the night had passed, had choice food, hard and soft, prepared in his abode, together with a quantity of <i>sukara-maddava,</i> <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-38' id='fnt-38'>[38]</a> and announced it to the Blessed One, saying: "It is time, O Lord, the meal is ready."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-18">18.</a> Thereupon the Blessed One, in the forenoon, having got ready, took bowl and robe and went with the community of bhikkhus to the house of Cunda, and there sat down on the seat prepared for him. And he spoke to Cunda, saying: "With the <i>sukara-maddava</i> you have prepared, Cunda, you may serve me; with the other food, hard and soft, you may serve the community of bhikkhus."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And with the <i>sukara-maddava</i> prepared by him, he served the Blessed One; and with the other food, hard and soft, he served the community of bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-19">19.</a> Thereafter the Blessed One spoke to Cunda, saying: "Whatever, Cunda, is left over of the <i>sukara-maddava,</i> bury that in a pit. For I do not see in all this world, with its gods, Maras, and Brahmas, among the host of ascetics and brahmans, gods and men, anyone who could eat it and entirely digest it except the Tathagata alone."</p>
<p>And Cunda the metalworker answered the Blessed One saying: "So be it, O Lord."And what remained over of the <i>sukara-maddava</i> he buried in a pit.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-20">20.</a> Then he returned to the Blessed One, respectfully greeted him, and sat down at one side. And the Blessed One instructed Cunda the metalworker in the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened him. After this he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-21">21.</a> And soon after the Blessed One had eaten the meal provided by Cunda the metalworker, a dire sickness fell upon him, even dysentery, and he suffered sharp and deadly pains. But the Blessed One endured them mindfully, clearly comprehending and unperturbed.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-22">22.</a> Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Come, Ananda, let us go to <a id="kusinara">Kusinara</a>." And the Venerable Ananda answered: "So be it, Lord."</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
<a id="para-4-23">23.</a> When he had eaten Cunda's food, I heard,
With fortitude the deadly pains he bore.
From the <i>sukara-maddava</i> a sore
And dreadful sickness came upon the Lord.
But nature's pangs he endured. "Come, let us go
To Kusinara," was his dauntless word. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-39' id='fnt-39'>[39]</a> 
</div>

<h2>The Clearing of the Waters</h2>
<p><a id="para-4-24">24.</a> Now on the way the Blessed One went aside from the highway and stopped at the foot of a tree. And he said to the Venerable Ananda: "Please fold my upper robe in four, Ananda, and lay it down. I am weary and want to rest awhile."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Venerable Ananda folded the robe in four and laid it down.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-25">25.</a> And the Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him and said to the Venerable Ananda: "Please bring me some water, Ananda. I am thirsty and want to drink."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-26">26.</a> And the Venerable Ananda answered the Blessed One: "But just now, Lord, a great number of carts, five hundred carts, have passed over, and the shallow water has been cut through by the wheels, so that it flows turbid and muddy. But the Kakuttha River, Lord, is quite close by, and its waters are clear, pleasant, cool, and translucent. It is easily approachable and delightfully placed. There the Blessed One can quench his thirst and refresh his limbs."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-27">27-29.</a> But a second time the Blessed One made his request, and the Venerable Ananda answered him as before. And then for a third time the Blessed One said: "Please bring me some water, Ananda. I am thirsty and want to drink."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-30">30.</a> Then the Venerable Ananda answered, saying: "So be it, Lord." And he took the bowl and went to the stream. And the shallow water, which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy, became clear and settled down, pure and pleasant as the Venerable Ananda drew near.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-31">31.</a> Then the Venerable Ananda thought: "Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the Tathagata!"</p>
<p><a id="para-4-32">32.</a> And he took up water in the bowl and carried it to the Blessed One, and said: "Marvellous and most wonderful indeed is the power and glory of the Tathagata! For this shallow water, which had been cut through by the wheels so that it flowed turbid and muddy, became clear and settled down, pure and pleasant as I drew near. Now let the Blessed One drink the water. Let the Happy One drink." And the Blessed One drank the water.</p>

<h2>Pukkusa the Malla</h2>
<p><a id="para-4-33">33.</a> Now it so happened that one <a id="pukkusa">Pukkusa</a> of the <a id="malla">Malla</a> clan, who was a disciple of <a id="alara">Alara Kalama</a>, was passing by on his way from Kusinara to Pava.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-40' id='fnt-40'>[40]</a></p>
<p><a id="para-4-34">34.</a> And when he saw the Blessed One seated at the foot of a tree, he approached him, respectfully greeted him, and sat down at one side. And he spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "Marvellous it is, Lord, most wonderful it is, O Lord, the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-35">35.</a> "For at one time, Lord, Alara Kalama was on a journey, and he went aside from the highway and sat down by the wayside at the foot of a tree to pass the heat of the day. And it came about, Lord, that a great number of carts, even five hundred carts, passed by him, one by one. And then, Lord, a certain man who was following behind that train of carts, approached and spoke to him, saying: 'Did you, sir, see a great number of carts that passed you by?' And Alara Kalama answered him: 'I did not see them, brother.' 'But the noise, sir, surely you heard?' 'I did not hear it, brother.' Then that man asked him: 'Then, sir, perhaps you slept?' 'No, brother, I was not sleeping.' 'Then, sir, were you conscious?' 'I was, brother.' Then that man said: 'Then, sir, while conscious and awake you still did not see the great number of carts, even five hundred carts, that passed you by one after another, nor heard the noise? Why, sir, your very robe is covered with their dust!' And Alara Kalama replied, saying: 'So it is, brother.'</p>
<p><a id="para-4-36">36.</a> "And to that man, O Lord, came the thought: 'Marvellous it is, most wonderful indeed it is, the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world!' And there arose in him great faith in Alara Kalama, and he went his way."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-37">37.</a> "Now what do you think, Pukkusa? What is more difficult to do, more difficult to meet with &mdash; that a man, while conscious and awake, should not see a great number of carts, even five hundred carts, that passed him by one after another, nor hear the noise, or that one conscious and awake, in the midst of a heavy rain, with thunder rolling, lightning flashing, and thunderbolts crashing, should neither see it nor hear the noise?"</p>
<p><a id="para-4-38">38.</a> "What, O Lord, are five hundred carts &mdash; nay, six, seven, eight, nine hundred, or a thousand or even hundreds of thousands of carts &mdash; compared with this?"</p>
<p><a id="para-4-39">39.</a> "Now one time, Pukkusa, I was staying at Atuma, and had my abode in a barn there. And at that time there was a heavy rain, with thunder rolling, lightning flashing, and thunderbolts crashing. And two farmers who were brothers were killed close to the barn, together with four oxen, and a great crowd came forth from Atuma to the spot where they were killed.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-40">40.</a> "Now at that time, Pukkusa, I had come out of the barn and was walking up and down in thought before the door. And a certain man from the great crowd approached me, respectfully greeted me, and stood at one side.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-41">41.</a> "And I asked him: 'Why, brother, has this great crowd gathered together?' And he answered me: 'Just now, Lord, there was a heavy rain, with thunder rolling, lightning flashing, and thunderbolts crashing. And two farmers who were brothers were killed close by, together with four oxen. It is because of this that the great crowd has gathered. But where, Lord, were you?'</p>
<p>"'I was here, brother.' 'Yet, Lord, did you not see it?' 'I did not see it, brother.' 'But the noise, Lord, you surely heard?' 'I did not hear it, brother.' Then that man asked me: 'Then, Lord, perhaps you slept?' 'No, brother, I was not sleeping.' 'Then, Lord, you were conscious?' 'I was, brother.' Then that man said: 'Then, Lord, while conscious and awake, in the midst of a heavy rain, with thunder rolling, lightning flashing, and thunderbolts crashing, you neither saw it nor heard the noise?' And I answered him, saying: 'I did not, brother.'</p>
<p><a id="para-4-42">42.</a> "And to that man, Pukkusa, came the thought: 'Marvellous it is, most wonderful indeed it is, the state of calmness wherein abide those who have gone forth from the world!' And there arose in him great faith in me, and he respectfully saluted me, and keeping his right side towards me, he went his way."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-43">43.</a> When this had been said, Pukkusa of the Malla clan said to the Blessed One: "The faith, Lord, that I had in Alara Kalama I now scatter to the mighty wind, I let it be carried away as by a flowing stream! Excellent, O Lord, most excellent, O Lord! It is as if, Lord, one were to set upright what had been overthrown, or to reveal what had been hidden, or to show the path to one who had gone astray, or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those having eyes might see &mdash; even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many ways. And so, O Lord, I take my refuge in the Blessed One, the Dhamma, and the Community of Bhikkhus. May the Blessed One accept me as his disciple, one who has taken refuge until the end of life."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-44">44.</a> Then Pukkusa of the Malla clan spoke to a certain man, saying: "Bring me at once, friend, two sets of golden-hued robes, burnished and ready for wear." And the man answered him: "So be it, sir."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-45">45.</a> And when the robes were brought, Pukkusa of the Malla clan offered them to the Blessed One, saying: "May the Blessed One, O Lord, out of compassion, accept this from me." And the Blessed One said: "Robe me, then in one, Pukkusa, and in the other robe Ananda."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And he thereupon robed the Blessed One in one, and in the other he robed the Venerable Ananda.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-46">46.</a> And then the Blessed One instructed Pukkusa of the Malla clan in the Dhamma, and roused, edified, and gladdened him. And after that, Pukkusa rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and keeping his right side towards him, went his way.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-47">47.</a> And soon after Pukkusa of the Malla clan had departed, the Venerable Ananda arranged the set of golden-hued robes, burnished and ready for wear, about the body of the Blessed One. But when the set of robes was arranged upon the body of the Blessed One, it became as though faded, and its splendor dimmed.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-48">48.</a> And the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "Marvellous it is, O Lord, most wonderful indeed it is, how clear and radiant the skin of the Tathagata appears! This set of golden-hued robes, burnished and ready for wear, Lord, now that it is arranged upon the body of the Blessed One seems to have become faded, its splendor dimmed."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-49">49.</a> "It is so, Ananda. There are two occasions, Ananda, when the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant. Which are these two? The night, Ananda, when the Tathagata becomes fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment, and the night when the Tathagata comes to his final passing away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains. These, Ananda, are the two occasions on which the skin of the Tathagata appears exceedingly clear and radiant.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-50">50.</a> "And now today, in the last watch of this very night, Ananda, in the Mallas' Sala Grove, in the vicinity of Kusinara, between two sala trees, the Tathagata will come to his Parinibbana. So now, Ananda, let us go to the <a id="kakuttha">Kakuttha</a> River."</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
<a id="para-4-51">51.</a> Clad in Pukkusa's gift, the robes of gold,
The Master's form was radiant to behold.
</div>

<h2>At the Kakuttha River</h2>
<p><a id="para-4-52">52.</a> Then the Blessed One went to the Kakuttha River together with a great community of bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-53">53.</a> And he went down into the water and bathed and drank. And coming forth from the water again, he went to the Mango Grove, and there spoke to the <a id="cundaka">Venerable Cundaka</a>, saying: "Please fold my upper robe in four, Cundaka, and lay it down. I am weary and would rest awhile."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And Cundaka folded the robe in four and laid it down.</p>
<p><a id="para-4-54">54.</a> And the Blessed One lay down on his right side, in the lion's posture, resting one foot upon the other, and so disposed himself, mindfully and clearly comprehending, with the time for rising held in mind. And the Venerable Cundaka sat down right in front of the Blessed One.</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
<a id="para-4-55">55.</a> The Buddha to Kakuttha's river came,
Where cool and limpid flows the pleasant stream;
There washed in water clear his weary frame
The Buddha  &mdash;  he in all the world supreme!
And having bathed and drank, the Teacher straight
Crossed over, the bhikkhus thronging in his wake.

Discoursing holy truths, the Master great
Towards the Mango Grove his path did take.
There to the elder Cundaka he spoke:
"Lay down my robe, please, folded into four."
Then the elder, swift as lightning stroke,
Hastened the Teacher's bidding to obey.
Weary, the Lord then lay down on the mat,
And Cunda on the ground before him sat.
</div>

<h2>Relieving Cunda's Remorse</h2>
<p><a id="para-4-56">56.</a> Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "It may come to pass, Ananda, that someone will cause remorse to Cunda the metalworker, saying: 'It is no gain to you, friend Cunda, but a loss, that it was from you the Tathagata took his last alms meal, and then came to his end.' Then, Ananda, the remorse of Cunda should be dispelled after this manner: 'It is a gain to you, friend Cunda, a blessing that the Tathagata took his last alms meal from you, and then came to his end. For, friend, face to face with the Blessed One I have heard and learned: "There are two offerings of food which are of equal fruition, of equal outcome, exceeding in grandeur the fruition and result of any other offerings of food. Which two? The one partaken of by the Tathagata before becoming fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment; and the one partaken of by the Tathagata before passing into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains. By his deed the worthy Cunda has accumulated merit which makes for long life, beauty, well being, glory, heavenly rebirth, and sovereignty."' Thus, Ananda, the remorse of Cunda the metalworker should be dispelled."</p>
<p><a id="para-4-57">57.</a> Then the Blessed One, understanding that matter, breathed forth the solemn utterance:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
Who gives, his virtues shall increase;
Who is self-curbed, no hatred bears;
Whoso is skilled in virtue, evil shuns,
And by the rooting out of lust and hate
And all delusion, comes to be at peace.

<h2>Last Place of Rest</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-1">1.</a> Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Come, Ananda, let us cross to the farther bank of the <a id="hirannavati">Hira&ntilde;&ntilde;avati</a>, and go to the Mallas' Sala Grove, in the vicinity of Kusinara."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-2">2.</a> And the Blessed One, together with a large company of bhikkhus, went to the further bank of the river Hira&ntilde;&ntilde;avati, to the Sala Grove of the Mallas, in the vicinity of Kusinara. And there he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying:</p>
<p><a id="para-5-3">3.</a> "Please, Ananda, prepare for me a couch between the twin sala trees, with the head to the north. I am weary, Ananda, and want to lie down."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-41' id='fnt-41'>[41]</a></p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Venerable Ananda did as the Blessed One asked him to do.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side, in the lion's posture, resting one foot upon the other, and so disposed himself, mindfully and clearly comprehending.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-4">4.</a> At that time the twin sala trees broke out in full bloom, though it was not the season of flowering. And the blossoms rained upon the body of the Tathagata and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata. And celestial <i>mandarava</i> flowers and heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rained down upon the body of the Tathagata, and dropped and scattered and were strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata. And the sound of heavenly voices and heavenly instruments made music in the air out of reverence for the Tathagata.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-5">5.</a> And the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Ananda, the twin sala trees are in full bloom, though it is not the season of flowering. And the blossoms rain upon the body of the Tathagata and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata. And celestial coral flowers and heavenly sandalwood powder from the sky rain down upon the body of the Tathagata, and drop and scatter and are strewn upon it in worship of the Tathagata. And the sound of heavenly voices and heavenly instruments makes music in the air out of reverence for the Tathagata.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-6">6.</a> "Yet it is not thus, Ananda, that the Tathagata is respected, venerated, esteemed, worshipped, and honored in the highest degree. But, Ananda, whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, layman or laywoman, abides by the Dhamma, lives uprightly in the Dhamma, walks in the way of the Dhamma, it is by such a one that the Tathagata is respected, venerated, esteemed, worshipped, and honored in the highest degree. Therefore, Ananda, thus should you train yourselves: 'We shall abide by the Dhamma, live uprightly in the Dhamma, walk in the way of the Dhamma.'"</p>

<h2>The Grief of the Gods</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-7">7.</a> At that time the <a id="upavana">Venerable Upavana</a> was standing before the Blessed One, fanning him. And the Blessed One rebuked him, saying: "Move aside, bhikkhu, do not stand in front of me."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-8">8.</a> And to the Venerable Ananda came the thought: "This Venerable Upavana has been in attendance on the Blessed One for a long time, closely associating with him and serving him. Yet now, right at the end, the Blessed One rebukes him. What now could be the reason, what the cause for the Blessed One to rebuke the Venerable Upavana, saying: 'Move aside, bhikkhu, do not stand in front of me'?"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-9">9-10.</a> And the Venerable Ananda told his thought to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said: "Throughout the tenfold world-system, Ananda, there are hardly any of the deities that have not gathered together to look upon the Tathagata. For a distance of twelve yojanas around the Sala Grove of the Mallas in the vicinity of Kusinara there is not a spot that could be pricked with the tip of a hair that is not filled with powerful deities. And these deities, Ananda, are complaining: 'From afar have we come to look upon the Tathagata. For rare in the world is the arising of Tathagatas, Arahants, Fully Enlightened Ones. And this day, in the last watch of the night, the Tathagata's Parinibbana will come about. But this bhikkhu of great powers has placed himself right in front of the Blessed One, concealing him, so that now, at the very end, we are prevented from looking upon him.' Thus, Ananda, the deities complain."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-11">11.</a> "Of what kind of deities, Lord, is the Blessed One aware?"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-12">12-13.</a> "There are deities, Ananda, in space and on earth, who are earthly-minded; with dishevelled hair they weep, with uplifted arms they weep; flinging themselves on the ground, they roll from side to side, lamenting: 'Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sight!'</p>
<p><a id="para-5-14">14.</a> "But those deities who are freed from passion, mindful and comprehending, reflect in this way: 'Impermanent are all compounded things. How could this be otherwise?'"</p>

<h2>Ananda's Concern</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-15">15.</a> "Formerly, Lord, on leaving their quarters after the rains, the bhikkhus would set forth to see the Tathagata, and to us there was the gain and benefit of receiving and associating with those very revered bhikkhus who came to have audience with the Blessed One and to wait upon him. But, Lord, after the Blessed One has gone, we shall no longer have that gain and benefit."</p>

<h2><a id="pil4">Four Places of Pilgrimage</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-5-16">16.</a> "There are four places, Ananda, that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-42' id='fnt-42'>[42]</a> What are the four?</p>
<p><a id="para-5-17">17.</a> "'Here the Tathagata was born!'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-43' id='fnt-43'>[43]</a> This, Ananda, is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-18">18.</a> "'Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment!'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-44' id='fnt-44'>[44]</a> This, Ananda, is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-19">19.</a> "'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma!'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-45' id='fnt-45'>[45]</a> This, Ananda, is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-20">20.</a> "'Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains!' This, Ananda, is a place that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-21">21.</a> "These, Ananda, are the four places that a pious person should visit and look upon with feelings of reverence. And truly there will come to these places, Ananda, pious bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, laymen and laywomen, reflecting: 'Here the Tathagata was born! Here the Tathagata became fully enlightened in unsurpassed, supreme Enlightenment! Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled Wheel of the Dhamma! Here the Tathagata passed away into the state of Nibbana in which no element of clinging remains!'</p>
<p><a id="para-5-22">22.</a> "And whoever, Ananda, should die on such a pilgrimage with his heart established in faith, at the breaking up of the body, after death, will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-23">23.</a> Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: "How, Lord, should we conduct ourselves towards women?"</p>
<p>"Do not see them, Ananda."</p>
<p>"But, Lord, if we do see them?"</p>
<p>"Do not speak, Ananda."</p>
<p>"But, Lord, if they should speak to us?"</p>
<p>"Then, Ananda, you should establish mindfulness."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-24">24.</a> Then the Venerable Ananda said: "How should we act, Lord, respecting the body of the Tathagata?"</p>
<p>"Do not hinder yourselves, Ananda, to honor the body of the Tathagata. Rather you should strive, Ananda, and be zealous on your own behalf,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-46' id='fnt-46'>[46]</a> for your own good. Unflinchingly, ardently, and resolutely you should apply yourselves to your own good. For there are, Ananda, wise nobles, wise brahmans, and wise householders who are devoted to the Tathagata, and it is they who will render the honor to the body of the Tathagata."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-25">25.</a> Then the Venerable Ananda said: "But how, Lord, should they act respecting the body of the Tathagata?"</p>
<p>"After the same manner, Ananda, as towards the body of a universal monarch."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-47' id='fnt-47'>[47]</a></p>
<p>"But how, Lord, do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch?"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-26">26.</a> "The body of a universal monarch, Ananda, is first wrapped round with new linen, and then with teased cotton wool, and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool. When that is done, the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-48' id='fnt-48'>[48]</a> oil vessel, which is enclosed in another iron vessel, a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods, and so the body of the universal monarch is burned; and at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarch. So it is done, Ananda, with the body of a universal monarch. And even, Ananda, as with the body of a universal monarch, so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata; and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the Tathagata. And whosoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalpaste, or pay reverence, and whose mind becomes calm there &mdash; it will be to his well being and happiness for a long time.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-27">27.</a> "There are <a id="stupa4">four persons</a>, Ananda, who are worthy of a stupa. Who are those four? A Tathagata, an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One is worthy of a stupa; so also is a Paccekabuddha,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-49' id='fnt-49'>[49]</a> and a disciple of a Tathagata, and a universal monarch.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-28">28-31.</a> "And why, Ananda, is a Tathagata, an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One worthy of a stupa? Because, Ananda, at the thought: 'This is the stupa of that Blessed One, Arahant, Fully Enlightened One!' the hearts of many people will be calmed and made happy; and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness. And so also at the thought: 'This is the stupa of that Paccekabuddha!' or 'This is the stupa of a disciple of that Tathagata, Arahant, Fully Enlightened One!' or 'This is the stupa of that righteous monarch who ruled according to Dhamma!' &mdash; the hearts of many people are calmed and made happy; and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness. And it is because of this, Ananda, that these four persons are worthy of a stupa."</p>

<h2>Ananda's Grief</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-32">32.</a> Then the Venerable Ananda went into the vihara<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-50' id='fnt-50'>[50]</a> and leaned against the doorpost and wept: "I am still but a learner,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-51' id='fnt-51'>[51]</a> and still have to strive for my own perfection. But, alas, my Master, who was so compassionate towards me, is about to pass away!"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-33">33.</a> And the Blessed One spoke to the bhikkhus, saying: "Where, bhikkhus, is Ananda?"</p>
<p>"The Venerable Ananda, Lord, has gone into the vihara and there stands leaning against the door post and weeping: 'I am still but a learner, and still have to strive for my own perfection. But, alas, my Master, who was so compassionate towards me, is about to pass away!'"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-34">34.</a> Then the Blessed One asked a certain bhikkhu to bring the Venerable Ananda to him, saying: "Go, bhikkhu, and say to Ananda, 'Friend Ananda, the Master calls you.'"</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And that bhikkhu went and spoke to the Venerable Ananda as the Blessed One had asked him to. And the Venerable Ananda went to the Blessed One, bowed down to him, and sat down on one side.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-35">35.</a> Then the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Enough, Ananda! Do not grieve, do not lament! For have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change, separation, and severance? Of that which is born, come into being, compounded, and subject to decay, how can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution!'? There can be no such state of things. Now for a long time, Ananda, you have served the Tathagata with loving-kindness in deed, word, and thought, graciously, pleasantly, with a whole heart and beyond measure. Great good have you gathered, Ananda! Now you should put forth energy, and soon you too will be free from the taints."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-52' id='fnt-52'>[52]</a></p>

<h2>Praise of Ananda</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-36">36.</a> Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus, the Blessed Ones, Arahants, Fully Enlightened Ones of times past also had excellent and devoted attendant bhikkhus, such as I have in Ananda. And so also, bhikkhus, will the Blessed Ones, Arahants, Fully Enlightened Ones of times to come.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-37">37.</a> "Capable and judicious is Ananda, bhikkhus, for he knows the proper time for bhikkhus to have audience with the Tathagata, and the time for bhikkhunis, the time for laymen and for laywomen; the time for kings and for ministers of state; the time for teachers of other sects and for their followers.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-38">38.</a> "<a id="ananda4">In Ananda</a>, bhikkhus, are to be found four rare and superlative qualities. What are the four? If, bhikkhus, a company of bhikkhus should go to see Ananda, they become joyful on seeing him; and if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma, they are made joyful by his discourse; and when he becomes silent, they are disappointed. So it is also when bhikkhunis, laymen, or laywomen go to see Ananda: they become joyful on seeing him; and if he then speaks to them of the Dhamma, they are made joyful by his discourse; and when he becomes silent, they are disappointed.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-39">39.</a> "<a id="monarch4">In a universal</a> monarch, bhikkhus, are to be found four rare and superlative qualities. What are those four? If, bhikkhus, a company of nobles should go to see the universal monarch, they become joyful on seeing him; and if he then speaks, they are made joyful by his talk; and when he becomes silent, they are disappointed. So it is also when a company of brahmans, of householders, or of ascetics goes to see a universal monarch.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-40">40.</a> "And in just the same way, bhikkhus, in Ananda are to be found these four rare and superlative qualities."</p>

<h2>The Past Glory of Kusinara</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-41">41.</a> When this had been said, the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "Let it not be, Lord, that the Blessed One should pass away in this mean place, this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle, a mere outpost of the province. There are great cities, Lord, such as <a id="campa">Campa</a>, Rajagaha, <a id="savatthi">Savatthi</a>, <a id="saketa">Saketa</a>, <a id="kosambi">Kosambi</a>, and <a id="benares">Benares</a> &mdash; let the Blessed One have his final passing away in one of those. For in those cities dwell many wealthy nobles and brahmans and householders who are devotees of the Tathagata, and they will render due honor to the remains of the Tathagata."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-42">42.</a> "Do not say that, Ananda! Do not say: 'This mean place, this uncivilized township in the midst of the jungle, a mere outpost of the province.' In times long past, Ananda, there was a king by the name of <a id="mahasudassana">Maha Sudassana</a>, who was a universal monarch, a king of righteousness, a conqueror of the four quarters of the earth, whose realm was established in security, and who was endowed with the seven jewels.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-53' id='fnt-53'>[53]</a> And that King Maha Sudassana, Ananda, had his royal residence here at Kusinara, which was then called <a id="kusavati">Kusavati</a>, and it extended twelve yojanas from east to west, and seven from north to south.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-43">43.</a> "And mighty, Ananda, was Kusavati, the capital, prosperous and well populated, much frequented by people, and abundantly provided with food. Just as the royal residence of the deities, <a id="alakamanda">Alakamanda</a>, is mighty, prosperous, and well populated, much frequented by deities and abundantly provided with food, so was the royal capital of Kusavati.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-44">44.</a> "Kusavati, Ananda, resounded unceasingly day and night with ten sounds &mdash; the trumpeting of elephants, the neighing of horses, the rattling of chariots, the beating of drums and tabours, music and song, cheers, the clapping of hands, and cries of 'Eat, drink, and be merry!'</p>

<h2>Lamentation of the Mallas</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-45">45.</a> "Go now, Ananda, to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas: 'Today, Vasetthas, in the last watch of the night, the Tathagata's Parinibbana will take place. Approach, O Vasetthas, draw near! Do not be remorseful later at the thought: "In our township it was that the Tathagata's Parinibbana took place, but we failed to see him at the end!"'"</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord." And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself, and taking bowl and robe, went with a companion to Kusinara.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-46">46.</a> Now at that time the Mallas had gathered in the council hall for some public business. And the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced: "Today, Vasetthas, in the last watch of the night, the Tathagata's Parinibbana will take place. Approach, Vasetthas, draw near! Do not be remorseful later at the thought: 'In our township it was that the Tathagata's Parinibbana took place, but we failed to see him at the end.'"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-47">47.</a> When they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words, the Mallas with their sons, their wives, and the wives of their sons, were sorely grieved, grieved at heart and afflicted; and some, with their hair all dishevelled, with arms uplifted in despair, wept; flinging themselves on the ground, they rolled from side to side, lamenting: "Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon will the Eye of the World vanish from sight!"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-48">48.</a> And thus afflicted and filled with grief, the Mallas, with their sons, their wives, and the wives of their sons, went to the Sala Grove, the recreation park of the Mallas, to the place where the Venerable Ananda was.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-49">49.</a> And the thought arose in the Venerable Ananda: "If I were to allow the Mallas of Kusinara to pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one, the night will have given place to dawn before they are all presented to him. Therefore let me divide them up according to clan, each family in a group, and so present them to the Blessed One thus: 'The Malla of such and such a name, Lord, with his wives and children, his attendants and his friends, pays homage at the feet of the Blessed One.'"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-50">50.</a> And the Venerable Ananda divided the Mallas up according to clan, each family in a group, and presented them to the Blessed One. So it was that the Venerable Ananda caused the Mallas of Kusinara to be presented to the Blessed One by clans, each family in a group, even in the first watch of the night.</p>

<h2>The Last Convert</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-51">51.</a> Now at that time a wandering ascetic named <a id="subbhada">Subhadda</a> was dwelling at Kusinara. And Subhadda the wandering ascetic heard it said: "Today in the third watch of the night, the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take place."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-52">52.</a> And the thought arose in him: "I have heard it said by old and venerable wandering ascetics, teachers of teachers, that the arising of Tathagatas, Arahants, Fully Enlightened Ones, is rare in the world. Yet this very day, in the last watch of the night, the Parinibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take place. Now there is in me a doubt; but to this extent I have faith in the ascetic Gotama, that he could so teach me the Dhamma as to remove that doubt."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-53">53.</a> Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda went to the Sala Grove, the recreation park of the Mallas, and drew near to the Venerable Ananda, and told the Venerable Ananda his thought. And he spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Friend Ananda, it would be good if I could be allowed into the presence of the ascetic Gotama."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-54">54.</a> But the Venerable Ananda answered him, saying: "Enough, friend Subhadda! Do not trouble the Tathagata. The Blessed One is weary."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-55">55-56.</a> Yet a second and a third time the wandering ascetic Subhadda made his request, and a second and a third time the Venerable Ananda refused him.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-57">57.</a> And the Blessed One heard the talk between them, and he called the Venerable Ananda and said: "Stop, Ananda! Do not refuse Subhadda. Subhadda, Ananda, may be allowed into the presence of the Tathagata. For whatever he will ask me, he will ask for the sake of knowledge, and not as an offence. And the answer I give him, that he will readily understand."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-58">58.</a> Thereupon the Venerable Ananda said to the wandering ascetic Subhadda: "Go then, friend Subhadda, the Blessed One gives you leave."</p>
<p><a id="paragraph5.59">59</a>. Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda approached the Blessed One and saluted him courteously. And having exchanged with him pleasant and civil greetings, the wandering ascetic Subhadda seated himself at one side and addressed the Blessed One, saying: "There are, Venerable Gotama, ascetics and brahmans who are heads of great companies of disciples, who have large retinues, who are leaders of schools, well known and renowned, and held in high esteem by the multitude, such teachers as <a id="purana">Purana Kassapa</a>, <a id="makkhali">Makkhali Gosala</a>, <a id="ajita">Ajita Kesakambali</a>, <a id="pakudha">Pakudha Kaccayana</a>, <a id="sanjaya">Sa&ntilde;jaya Belatthaputta</a>, <a id="nigantha">Nigantha Nataputta</a>. Have all of these attained realization, as each of them would have it believed, or has none of them, or is it that some have attained realization and others not?"</p>
<p><a id="para-5-60">60.</a> "Enough, Subhadda! Let it be as it may, whether all of them have attained realization, as each of them would have it believed, or whether none of them has, or whether some have attained realization and others not. I will teach you the Dhamma, Subhadda; listen and heed it well, and I will speak."</p>
<p>"So be it, Lord."</p>

<h2>The Lion's Roar</h2>
<p><a id="para-5-61">61.</a> And the Blessed One spoke, saying: "In whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda, there is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither is there found a true ascetic of the first, second, third, or fourth degree of saintliness. But in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path, there is found a true ascetic of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-54' id='fnt-54'>[54]</a> Now in this Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda, is found the Noble Eightfold Path; and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness. Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers. But if, Subhadda, the bhikkhus live righteously, the world will not be destitute of arahats.</p>
<p><a id="para-5-62">62.</a> "In age but twenty-nine was I, Subhadda,</p>
When I renounced the world to seek the Good;<br />
Fifty-one years have passed since then, Subhadda,<br />
And in all that time a wanderer have I been<br />
In the domain of virtue and of truth,<br />
And except therein, there is no saint<br />
(of the first degree).
<p>"And there is none of the second degree, nor of the third degree, nor of the fourth degree of saintliness. Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers. But if, Subhadda, the bhikkhus live righteously, the world will not be destitute of arahats."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-63">63.</a> When this was said, the wandering ascetic Subhadda spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "<a id="magnif">Excellent</a>, O Lord, most excellent, O Lord! It is as if, Lord, one were to set upright what had been overthrown, or to reveal what had been hidden, or to show the path to one who had gone astray, or to light a lamp in the darkness so that those with eyes might see &mdash; even so has the Blessed One set forth the Dhamma in many ways. And so, O Lord, I take my refuge in the Blessed One, the Dhamma, and the Community of Bhikkhus. May I receive from the Blessed One admission to the Order and also the higher ordination."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-64">64.</a> "Whoever, Subhadda, having been formerly a follower of another creed, wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline, remains on probation for a period of four months. At the end of those four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu. Yet in this matter I recognize differences of personalities."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-65">65.</a> "If, O Lord, whoever, having been formerly a follower of another creed, wishes to receive admission and higher ordination in this Dhamma and Discipline, remains on probation for a period of four months, and at the end of those four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they grant him admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu &mdash; then I will remain on probation for a period of four years. And at the end of those four years, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them grant me admission and higher ordination as a bhikkhu."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-66">66.</a> But the Blessed One called the Venerable Ananda and said to him: "Ananda, let Subhadda be given admission into the Order." And the Venerable Ananda replied: "So be it, Lord."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-67">67.</a> Then the wandering ascetic Subhadda said to the Venerable Ananda: "It is a gain to you, friend Ananda, a blessing, that in the presence of the Master himself you have received the sprinkling of ordination as a disciple."</p>
<p><a id="para-5-68">68.</a> <a id="ordain">So it</a> came about that the wandering ascetic Subhadda, in the presence of the Blessed One, received admission and higher ordination. And from the time of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda remained alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute. <a id="victory">And before</a> long he attained to the goal for which a worthy man goes forth rightly from home to homelessness, the supreme goal of the holy life; and having by himself realized it with higher knowledge, he dwelt therein. He knew: "Destroyed is birth; the higher life is fulfilled; nothing more is to be done, and beyond this life nothing more remains." And the Venerable Subhadda became yet another among the arahats, and he was the last disciple converted by the Blessed One himself.</p>

<h2>The Blessed One's Final Exhortation</h2>
<p><a id="para-6-1">1.</a> Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "It may be, Ananda, that to some among you the thought will come: 'Ended is the word of the Master; we have a Master no longer.' But it should not, Ananda, be so considered. For that which I have proclaimed and made known as the Dhamma and the Discipline, that shall be your Master when I am gone.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-2">2.</a> "And, Ananda, whereas now the bhikkhus address one another as 'friend,' let it not be so when I am gone. The senior bhikkhus, Ananda, may address the junior ones by their name, their family name, or as 'friend'; but the junior bhikkhus should address the senior ones as 'venerable sir' or 'your reverence.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-55' id='fnt-55'>[55]</a></p>
<p><a id="para-6-3">3.</a> "If it is desired, Ananda, the Sangha may, when I am gone, abolish the lesser and minor rules.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-56' id='fnt-56'>[56]</a></p>
<p><a id="para-6-4">4.</a> "Ananda, when I am gone, let the higher penalty be imposed upon the bhikkhu <a id="channa">Channa</a>."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-57' id='fnt-57'>[57]</a></p>
<p>"But what, Lord, is the higher penalty?"</p>
<p>"The bhikkhu Channa, Ananda, may say what he will, but the bhikkhus should neither converse with him, nor exhort him, nor admonish him."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-5">5.</a> Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "It may be, bhikkhus, that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, the path or the practice. Then question, bhikkhus! Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought: 'The Master was with us face to face, yet face to face we failed to ask him.'"</p>
<p><a id="para-6-6">6.</a> But when this was said, the bhikkhus were silent. And yet a second and a third time the Blessed One said to them: "It may be, bhikkhus, that one of you is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, the path or the practice. Then question, bhikkhus! Do not be given to remorse later on with the thought: 'The Master was with us face to face, yet face to face we failed to ask him.'"</p>
<p>And for a second and a third time the bhikkhus were silent. Then the Blessed One said to them: "It may be, bhikkhus, out of respect for the Master that you ask no questions. Then, bhikkhus, let friend communicate it to friend." Yet still the bhikkhus were silent.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-7">7.</a> And the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Blessed One, saying: "Marvellous it is, O Lord, most wonderful it is! This faith I have in the community of bhikkhus, that not even one bhikkhu is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, the path or the practice."</p>
<p>"Out of faith, Ananda, you speak thus. But here, Ananda, the Tathagata knows for certain that among this community of bhikkhus there is not even one bhikkhu who is in doubt or perplexity as to the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, the path or the practice. For, Ananda, among these five hundred bhikkhus even the lowest is a stream-enterer, secure from downfall, assured, and bound for enlightenment."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-8">8.</a> And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Behold now, bhikkhus, I exhort you: All compounded things are subject to vanish. Strive with earnestness!"<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-58' id='fnt-58'>[58]</a></p>
<p>This was the last word of the Tathagata.</p>

<h2>How the Blessed One Passed into Nibbana</h2>
<p><a id="para-6-9">9.</a> And the Blessed One entered the first jhana. Rising from the first jhana, he entered the second jhana. Rising from the second jhana, he entered the third jhana. Rising from the third jhana, he entered the fourth jhana. And rising out of the fourth jhana, he entered the sphere of infinite space. Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space, he entered the sphere of infinite consciousness. Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness, he entered the sphere of nothingness. Rising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness, he entered the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. And rising out of the attainment of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he attained to the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-10">10.</a> And the Venerable Ananda spoke to the Venerable <a id="anuruddha">Anuruddha</a>, saying: "Venerable Anuruddha, the Blessed One has passed away."</p>
<p>"No, friend Ananda, the Blessed One has not passed away. He has entered the state of the cessation of perception and feeling."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-59' id='fnt-59'>[59]</a></p>
<p><a id="para-6-11">11.</a> Then the Blessed One, rising from the cessation of perception and feeling, entered the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Rising from the attainment of the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, he entered the sphere of nothingness. Rising from the attainment of the sphere of nothingness, he entered the sphere of infinite consciousness. Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite consciousness, he entered the sphere of infinite space. Rising from the attainment of the sphere of infinite space, he entered the fourth jhana. Rising from the fourth jhana, he entered the third jhana. Rising from the third jhana, he entered the second jhana. Rising from the second jhana, he entered the first jhana.</p>
<p>Rising from the first jhana, he entered the second jhana. Rising from the second jhana, he entered the third jhana. Rising from the third jhana, he entered the fourth jhana. And, rising from the fourth jhana, the Blessed One immediately passed away.</p>

<h2>The World's Echo</h2>
<p><a id="para-6-12">12.</a> And when the Blessed One had passed away, simultaneously with his Parinibbana there came a tremendous earthquake, dreadful and astounding, and the thunders rolled across the heavens.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-13">13.</a> And when the Blessed One had passed away, simultaneously with his Parinibbana, <a id="sahampati">Brahma Sahampati</a><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-60' id='fnt-60'>[60]</a> spoke this stanza:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
All must depart  &mdash;  all beings that have life
Must shed their compound forms. Yea, even one,
A Master such as he, a peerless being,
Powerful in wisdom, the Enlightened One, has passed away.
</div>
<p><a id="para-6-14">14.</a> And when the Blessed One had passed away, simultaneously with his Parinibbana, <a id="sakka">Sakka</a>, king of the gods,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-61' id='fnt-61'>[61]</a> spoke this stanza:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
Transient are all compounded things,
Subject to arise and vanish;
Having come into existence they pass away;
Good is the peace when they forever cease.
</div>
<p><a id="para-6-15">15.</a> And when the Blessed One had passed away, simultaneously with his Parinibbana, the Venerable Anuruddha spoke this stanza:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
No movement of the breath, but with steadfast heart,
Free from desires and tranquil  &mdash;  so the sage
Comes to his end. By mortal pangs unshaken,
His mind, like a flame extinguished, finds release.
</div>
<p><a id="para-6-16">16.</a> And when the Blessed One had passed away, simultaneously with his Parinibbana, the Venerable Ananda spoke this stanza:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
Then there was terror, and the hair stood up, when he,
The All-accomplished One, the Buddha, passed away.
</div>
<p><a id="para-6-17">17.</a> Then, when the Blessed One had passed away, some bhikkhus, not yet freed from passion, lifted up their arms and wept; and some, flinging themselves on the ground, rolled from side to side and wept, lamenting: "Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight!"</p>
<p>But the bhikkhus who were freed from passion, mindful and clearly comprehending, reflected in this way: "Impermanent are all compounded things. How could this be otherwise?"</p>
<p><a id="para-6-18">18.</a> And the Venerable Anuruddha addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Enough, friends! Do not grieve, do not lament! For has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change, separation, and severance? Of that which is born, come into being, compounded and subject to decay, how can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution!'? The deities, friends, are aggrieved."</p>
<p>"But, venerable sir, of what deities is the Venerable Anuruddha aware?"</p>
<p>"There are deities, friend Ananda, in space and on the earth who are earthly-minded; with dishevelled hair they weep, with uplifted arms they weep; flinging themselves on the ground, they roll from side to side, lamenting: 'Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight!' But those deities who are freed from passion, mindful and clearly comprehending, reflect in this way: 'Impermanent are all compounded things. How could this be otherwise?'"</p>
<p><a id="para-6-19">19.</a> Now the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ananda spent the rest of the night in talking on the Dhamma. Then the Venerable Anuruddha spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "Go now, friend Ananda, to Kusinara, and announce to the Mallas: 'The Blessed One, Vasetthas, has passed away. Do now as seems fitting to you.'"</p>
<p>"So be it, venerable sir." And the Venerable Ananda prepared himself in the forenoon, and taking bowl and robe, went with a companion into Kusinara.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-20">20.</a> At that time the Mallas of Kusinara had gathered in the council hall to consider that very matter. And the Venerable Ananda approached them and announced: "The Blessed One, Vasetthas, has passed away. Do now as seems fitting to you."</p>
<p>And when they heard the Venerable Ananda speak these words, the Mallas with their sons, their wives, and the wives of their sons, were sorely grieved, grieved at heart and afflicted; and some, with their hair all dishevelled, with arms upraised in despair, wept; flinging themselves on the ground, they rolled from side to side, lamenting: "Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana! "Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight!"</p>

<h2>Homage to the Remains</h2>
<p><a id="para-6-21">21.</a> Then the Mallas of Kusinara gave orders to their men, saying: "Gather now all the perfumes, flower-garlands, and musicians, even all that are in Kusinara." And the Mallas, with the perfumes, the flower-garlands, and the musicians, and with five hundred sets of clothing, went to the Sala Grove, the recreation park of the Mallas, and approached the body of the Blessed One. And having approached, they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance, song, music, flower-garlands, and perfume, and erecting canopies and pavilions, they spent the day showing respect, honor, and veneration to the body of the Blessed One. And then the thought came to them: "Now the day is too far spent for us to cremate the body of the Blessed One. Tomorrow we will do it."</p>
<p>And for the second day, and a third, fourth, fifth, and sixth day, they paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance, song, music, flower-garlands, and perfume, and erecting canopies and pavilions, they spent the day showing respect, honor, and veneration to the body of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>But on the seventh day the thought came to them: "We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance, song, music, flower-garlands, and perfume, and have shown respect, honor, and veneration; let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond, and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the town."</p>
<p>And eight Mallas of the foremost families, bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes, with the thought: "We will lift up the body of the Blessed One," tried to do so but they could not.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-22">22.</a> Then the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha, saying: "What is the cause, Venerable Anuruddha, what is the reason that these eight Mallas of the foremost families, bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes, with the thought: 'We will lift up the body of the Blessed One,' try to do so but cannot?"</p>
<p>"You, Vasetthas, have one purpose, the deities have another."</p>
<p>"Then what, venerable sir, is the purpose of the deities?"</p>
<p>"Your purpose, Vasetthas, is this: 'We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with dance, song, music, flower-garlands, and perfume, and have shown respect, honor, and veneration; let us now carry the body of the Blessed One southward to the southern part of the town and beyond, and let us there cremate the body of the Blessed One south of the town.' But the purpose of the deities, Vasetthas, is this: 'We have paid homage to the body of the Blessed One with heavenly dance, song, music, flower-garlands, and perfume, and have shown respect, honor, and veneration; let us now carry the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town; and having carried it through the northern gate, let us go through the center of the town, and then eastward to the east of the town; and having passed through the east gate, let us carry it to the cetiya of the Mallas, <a id="makuta">Makuta-bandhana</a>, and there let us cremate the body of the Blessed One.'"</p>
<p>"As the deities wish, venerable sir, so let it be."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-23">23.</a> Thereupon the whole of Kusinara, even to the dust heaps and rubbish heaps, became covered knee-deep in <i>mandarava</i> flowers.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-62' id='fnt-62'>[62]</a> And homage was paid to the body of the Blessed One by the deities as well as the Mallas of Kusinara. With dance, song, music, flower-garlands, and perfume, both divine and human, respect, honor, and veneration were shown. And they carried the body of the Blessed One northward to the northern part of the town; and having carried it through the northern gate, they went through the center of the town, and then eastward to the east of the town; and having passed through the east gate, they carried the body of the Blessed One to the cetiya of the Mallas, Makuta-bandhana, and there laid it down.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-24">24.</a> Then the Mallas of Kusinara spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "How should we act, Venerable Ananda, respecting the body of the Tathagata?"</p>
<p>"After the same manner, Vasetthas, as towards the body of a universal monarch."</p>
<p>"But how, venerable Ananda, do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch?"</p>
<p>"The body of a universal monarch, Vasetthas, is first wrapped round with new linen, and then with teased cotton wool. And again it is wrapped round with new linen, and again with teased cotton wool, and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool. When that is done, the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oil-vessel, which is enclosed in another iron vessel and a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods, and so the body of the universal monarch is burned. And at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarch. So it is done, Vasetthas, with the body of a universal monarch.</p>
<p>"And even, Vasetthas, as with the body of a universal monarch, so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata; and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the Tathagata. And whoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalwood paste, or pay reverence, and whose mind becomes calm there &mdash; it will be to his well being and happiness for a long time."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-25">25.</a> Then the Mallas gave orders to their men, saying: "Gather now all the teased cotton wool of the Mallas!" And the Mallas of Kusinara wrapped the body of the Blessed One round with new linen, and then with teased cotton wool. And again they wrapped it round with new linen, and again with teased cotton wool, and so it was done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool. When that was done, they placed the body of the Blessed One in an iron oil-vessel, which was enclosed in another iron vessel, and they built a funeral pyre of all kinds of perfumed woods, and upon it they laid the body of the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-26">26.</a> Now at that time the <a id="kassapa">Venerable Maha Kassapa</a><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-63' id='fnt-63'>[63]</a> was journeying from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhus. And on the way, the Venerable Maha Kassapa went aside from the highway and sat down at the foot of a tree.</p>
<p>And a certain Ajivaka came by, on his way to Pava, and he had taken a <i>mandarava</i> flower from Kusinara. And the Venerable Maha Kassapa saw the Ajivaka coming from a distance, and as he drew close he spoke to him, saying: "Do you know, friend, anything of our Master?"</p>
<p>"Yes, friend, I know. It is now seven days since the ascetic Gotama passed away. From there I have brought this <i>mandarava</i> flower."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-27">27.</a> Thereupon some bhikkhus, not yet freed from passion, lifted up their arms and wept; and some, flinging themselves on the ground, rolled from side to side and wept, lamenting: "Too soon has the Blessed One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Happy One come to his Parinibbana! Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from sight!"</p>
<p><a id="para-6-28">28.</a> Now at that time, one <a id="subhadda2">Subhadda</a>, who had renounced only in his old age, was seated in the assembly.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-64' id='fnt-64'>[64]</a> And he addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Enough, friends! Do not grieve, do not lament! We are well rid of that great ascetic. Too long, friends, have we been oppressed by his saying: 'This is fitting for you; that is not fitting for you.' Now we shall be able to do as we wish, and what we do not wish, that we shall not do."</p>
<p>But the Venerable Maha Kassapa addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Enough friends! Do not grieve, do not lament! For has not the Blessed One declared that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change, separation, and severance? Of that which is born, come into being, compounded, and subject to decay, how can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution!'?"</p>
<p><a id="para-6-29">29.</a> Now at that time four Mallas of the foremost families, bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes, with the thought: "We will set alight the Blessed One's pyre," tried to do so but they could not. And the Mallas spoke to the Venerable Anuruddha, saying: "What is the cause, Venerable Anuruddha, what is the reason that these four Mallas of the foremost families, bathed from the crown of their heads and wearing new clothes, with the thought: "We will set alight the Blessed One's pyre,' try to do so but cannot?"</p>
<p>"You, Vasetthas, have one purpose, the deities have another."</p>
<p>"Then what, venerable sir, is the purpose of the deities?"</p>
<p>"The purpose of the deities, Vasetthas, is this: 'The Venerable Maha Kassapa is on his way from Pava to Kusinara together with a large company of five hundred bhikkhus. Let not the Blessed One's pyre be set alight until the Venerable Maha Kassapa has paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One.'"</p>
<p>"As the deities wish, venerable sir, so let it be."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-30">30.</a> And the Venerable Maha Kassapa approached the pyre of the Blessed One, at the cetiya of the Mallas, Makuta-bandhana, in Kusinara. And he arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and with his clasped hands raised in salutation, he walked three times round the pyre, keeping his right side towards the Blessed One's body, and he paid homage at the feet of the Blessed One. And even so did the five hundred bhikkhus.</p>
<p>And when homage had been paid by the Venerable Maha Kassapa and the five hundred bhikkhus, the pyre of the Blessed One burst into flame by itself.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-31">31.</a> And it came about that when the body of the Blessed One had been burned, no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin, tissue, flesh, sinews, and fluid; only bones remained. Just as when ghee or oil is burned, it leaves no particles or ashes behind, even so when the body of the Blessed One had been burned, no ashes or particles were to be seen of what had been skin, tissue, flesh, sinews, and fluid; only bones remained. And of the five hundred linen wrappings, only two were not consumed, the innermost and the outermost.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-32">32.</a> And when the body of the Blessed One had been burned, water rained down from heaven and extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One, and from the sala trees water came forth, and the Mallas of Kusinara brought water scented with many kinds of perfumes, and they too extinguished the pyre of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>And the Mallas of Kusinara laid the relics of the Blessed One in their council hall, and surrounded them with a lattice-work of spears and encircled them with a fence of bows; and there for seven days they paid homage to the relics of the Blessed One with dance, song, music, flower-garlands, and perfume, and showed respect, honor, and veneration to the relics of the Blessed One.</p>

<h2><a id="relics">Partition of the Relics</a></h2>
<p><a id="para-6-33">33.</a> Then the king of Magadha, Ajatasattu, son of the Videhi queen, came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away. And he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara, saying: "The Blessed One was of the warrior caste, and I am too. I am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. I will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-34">34.</a> And the Licchavis of Vesali came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away. And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara, saying: "The Blessed One was of the warrior caste, and we are too. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-35">35.</a> And the <a id="sakya">Sakyas</a> of <a id="kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a> came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away. And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara, saying: "The Blessed One was the greatest of our clan. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-36">36.</a> And the <a id="buli">Bulis</a> of <a id="allakappa">Allakappa</a> came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away. And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara, saying: "The Blessed One was of the warrior caste, and we are too. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-37">37.</a> And the <a id="koli">Kolis</a> of <a id="ramagama">Ramagama</a> came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away. And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara, saying: "The Blessed One was of the warrior caste, and we are too. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-38">38.</a> And the <a id="vethadipa">Vethadipa</a> brahman came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away. And he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara, saying: "The Blessed One was of the warrior caste, and I am a brahman. I am worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. I will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-39">39.</a> And the Mallas of Pava came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away. And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara, saying: "The Blessed One was of the warrior caste, and we are too. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor."</p>
<p><a id="para-6-40">40.</a> But when they heard these words, the Mallas of Kusinara addressed the assembly, saying: "The Blessed One has passed away in our township. We shall not part with any portion of the relics of the Blessed One." Then the <a id="dona">brahman Dona</a> spoke to the assembly, saying:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
One word from me, I beg you, sirs, to hear!
Our Buddha taught us ever to forbear;
Unseemly would it be should strife arise
And war and bloodshed, over the custody
Of his remains, who was the best of men!
Let us all, sirs, in friendliness agree
To share eight portions  &mdash;  so that far and wide
Stupas may rise, and seeing them, mankind
Faith in the All-Enlightened One will find!
</div>
<p>"So be it, brahman! Divide the relics into eight equal portions yourself."</p>
<p>And the brahman Dona said to the assembly: "So be it, sirs." And he divided justly into eight equal portions the relics of the Blessed One, and having done so, he addressed the assembly, saying: "Let this urn, sirs, be given to me. Over this urn I will erect a stupa, and in its honor I will hold a festival." And the urn was given to the brahman Dona.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-41">41.</a> Then the <a id="mori">Moriyas</a> of <a id="pippha">Pipphalivana</a> came to know that at Kusinara the Blessed One had passed away. And they sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinara, saying: "The Blessed One was of the warrior caste, and we are too. We are worthy to receive a portion of the relics of the Blessed One. We will erect a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One and hold a festival in their honor."</p>
<p>"There is no portion of the relics of the Blessed One remaining; the relics of the Blessed One have been divided. But take from here the ashes." And they took from there the ashes.</p>
<p><a id="para-6-42">42.</a> And the king of Magadha, Ajatasattu, son of the Videhi queen, erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Rajagaha, and in their honor held a festival. The Licchavis of Vesali erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Vesali, and in their honor held a festival. The Sakyas of Kapilavatthu erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Kapilavatthu, and in their honor held a festival. The Bulis of Allakappa erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Allakappa, and in their honor held a festival. The Kolis of Ramagama erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Ramagama, and in their honor held a festival. The Vethadipa brahman erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Vethadipa, and in their honor held a festival. The Mallas of Pava erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Pava, and in their honor held a festival. The Mallas of Kusinara erected a stupa over the relics of the Blessed One at Kusinara, and in their honor held a festival. The brahman Dona erected a stupa over the urn, and in its honor held a festival. And the Moriyas of Pipphalivana erected a stupa over the ashes at Pipphalivana, and in their honor held a festival.</p>
<p>So it came about that there were eight stupas for the relics, a ninth for the urn, and a tenth for the ashes.</p>
<p>And thus it was in the days of old.</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
<a id="para-6-43">43.</a> Eight portions there were of the relics of him,
The All-Seeing One, the greatest of men.
Seven in Jambudipa are honored, and one
In Ramagama, by kings of the Naga race.
One tooth is honored in the Tavatimsa heaven,
One in the realm of Kalinga, and one by the Naga kings.
Through their brightness this bountiful earth
With its most excellent gifts is endowed;
For thus the relics of the All-Seeing One are best honored
By those who are worthy of honor  &mdash;  by gods and Nagas
And lords of men, yea, by the highest of mankind.
Pay homage with clasped hands! For hard indeed it is
Through hundreds of ages to meet with an All-Enlightened One!<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-65' id='fnt-65'>[65]</a>

	<dd>Virtue <i>(sila),</i> concentration <i>(samadhi),</i> and wisdom <i>(pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a)</i> are the three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path. Our text stresses again and again the importance of a full development of all three for final liberation.</dd>

	<dd><i>Asava:</i> those defiling factors &mdash; sensual desire, craving for existence, and ignorance &mdash; primarily responsible for maintaining bondage to the cycle of rebirths. Also translated as "cankers" or "corruptions." Later texts add a fourth, the taint of wrong views.</dd>

	<dd><i>Evam-dhamma.</i> Comy. &amp; Sub. Comy.: This refers to concentration and to the mental qualities belonging to concentration <i>(samadhipakkhiya dhamma)</i> such as energy, mindfulness, etc. Comy. explains "abiding" <i>(vihara)</i> as abiding in the attainment of cessation <i>(nirodha-samapatti).</i></dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-16" id="fn-16">16</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Puta-bhedanam.</i> Comy. explains as the breaking open, the unpacking, of boxes <i>(puta)</i> of merchandise for the purpose of distribution. But probably it refers to the bursting open of the seed-box of the <i>patali</i> flower.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-17" id="fn-17">17</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The stage of arahatship, the last of the four stages of deliverance. The next three paragraphs refer to disciples on the three lower stages, respectively, the non-returner, once-returner, and stream-enterer <i>(anagami, sakadagami, sotapanna).</i></dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-18" id="fn-18">18</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Or: "not delayed (in its results)."</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-19" id="fn-19">19</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Animitta cetosamadhi.</i> Comy. explains this term here as referring to the fruition-attainment of arahatship <i>(phalasamapatti),</i> in which the Buddha becomes absorbed in the direct experience of Nibbana and no longer attends to external objects or feels mundane feelings. In another context it can mean the concentration developed by intensive insight.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-20" id="fn-20">20</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Tamatagge:</i> a difficult word. Comy. takes it to stand for the superlative form, <i>aggatama,</i> "highest," but alludes also to the Pali word <i>tama,</i> "darkness." It is rather difficult to accept that a superlative suffix should be made to precede the word it qualifies. Tibetan and Chinese parallels (Waldschmidt, <i>Das Mahaparinirvana-sutra</i> Berlin, 1950-51) pp. 200 ff.) point to a meaning as "the highest." In the fragments of the Turfan Sanskrit version, these words are not preserved. Comy. says: "<i>Tamatagge</i> = <i>tama-agge;</i> the 't' in the middle is inserted for euphonic reasons. The meaning is: these are the very highest, the most eminent <i>(ime aggatama tamatagga).</i> Having cut every bondage of darkness <i>(tama-yoga),</i> those bhikkhus of mine will be on the very top, in the highest rank <i>(ativiya agge uttamabhave).</i> Among them those will be on the very summit <i>(ati-agge)</i> who are desirous of training; and those whose resort is the four foundations of mindfulness will be at the very top of them."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-21" id="fn-21">21</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Kappam va tittheyya kappavasesam va.</i> Comy. takes <i>kappa</i> not as "world-period" or "aeon," but as <i>ayu-kappa,</i> "life span," and explains <i>avasesa</i> (usually "remainder") by "in excess."
	<p>Comy.: "He may stay alive completing the life span pertaining to men at the given time. (Sub. Comy.: the maximum life span.) <i>Kappavasesa:</i> 'in excess' <i>(atireka),</i> i.e., more or less above the hundred years said to be the normally highest life expectation."</p>
	<p>Among the numerous meanings of the word <i>kappa,</i> there is, in fact, that of time in general <i>(kala)</i> and not only the duration of an aeon; but the meaning "life span" seems to have been ascribed to it only in this passage. Also, the meaning "in excess" for <i>avasesa</i> (usually "remainder") is unusual.</p>
	<p>The four constituents of psychic power <i>(iddhipada)</i> are concentration due to zeal, energy, purity of mind, and investigation.</p>
	</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-22" id="fn-22">22</a>.</dt>
	<dd>According to Comy., Ananda's mind had been influenced <i>(pariyutthitacitto)</i> by Mara's exhibiting a frightful sight which distracted his attention, preventing him from grasping the Buddha's suggestion.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-23" id="fn-23">23</a>.</dt>
	<dd>"Convincing and liberating." This stands for the one Pali word <i>sappatihariya,</i> an attempt to render the two connotations which the word has according to the commentaries and in the context of other occurrences in the Canon. The commentaries derive it from the verb <i>patiharati,</i> "to remove," and explain it as (1) the removal of what is adverse, e.g., opposition and objections (covered by "convincing"), and (2) the removal of inner obstructions, i.e., defilements such as greed, etc., effected by arahatship. It is probably to point to that latter meaning that the commentary to our present text paraphrases our passage as follows: "until they are able to preach the Teaching in its liberating <i>(niyyanika)</i> capacity."</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-24" id="fn-24">24</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Tulam atula&ntilde;ca sambhavam:</i> lit. "the measurable and immeasurable productive cause (of life)," i.e., the volitional action causing rebirth in the confined, or limited sense-sphere, or in the unbounded fine-material and immaterial spheres.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-25" id="fn-25">25</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Bhavasankhara:</i> the formative force of becoming, in the sense of what forms existence.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-26" id="fn-26">26</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Kavacam iv'attasambhavam.</i> Comy.: "He breaks through the entire net of defilements that envelops individual existence like a coat of mail; he breaks the defilements as a great warrior breaks his armor after a battle." The Sanskrit version has "like an egg shell" <i>(kosam iv' anda-sambhavam).</i></dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-27" id="fn-27">27</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Comy.: "Even by this much the Venerable Ananda was aware of the fact: 'Surely, today the Blessed One has renounced his will to live on.' Though the Blessed One knew that the Venerable Ananda was aware of it, he did not give him another opportunity to ask him to stay on for the remainder of his life span, but he spoke to him about other eight-term groups beginning with the eight assemblies." Sub. Comy.: "Some say that the Buddha did so in order to divert the Venerable Ananda and to prevent grief from arising in him."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-37" id="fn-37">37</a>.</dt>
	<dd>In the earlier edition of this work, <i>mahapadesa</i> was rendered as "great authorities." It is now known that the proper meaning of <i>apadesa</i> is not "authority," but "reference" or "source." Besides, from the passage it is clear that there are only two real "authorities" &mdash; the Discourses (Suttas) and the Discipline (Vinaya).</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-38" id="fn-38">38</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Sukara-maddava:</i> a controversial term which has therefore been left untranslated. <i>Sukara</i> = pig; <i>maddava</i> = soft, tender, delicate. Hence two alternative renderings of the compound are possible: (1) the tender parts <i>of</i> a pig or boar; (2) what is enjoyed <i>by</i> pigs and boars. In the latter meaning, the term has been thought to refer to a mushroom or truffle, or a yam or tuber. K.E. Neumann, in the preface to his German translation of the Majjhima Nikaya, quotes from an Indian compendium of medicinal plants, the <i>Rajanigantu,</i> several plants beginning with <i>sukara.</i>
	<p>The commentary to our text gives three alternative explanations: (1) the flesh from a single first-born (wild) pig, neither too young nor too old, which had come to hand naturally, i.e., without intentional killing; (2) a preparation of soft boiled rice cooked with the five cow-products; (3) a kind of alchemistic elixir <i>(rasayanavidhi).</i> Dhammapala, in his commentary to Udana VIII.5, gives, in addition, young bamboo shoots trampled by pigs <i>(sukarehi maddita-vamsakaliro).</i></p>

	<dd>Alara Kalama was one of the Buddha's teachers before his Enlightenment. He taught the Bodhisatta how to attain the sphere of nothingness, but could not show him the path to Nibbana.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-41" id="fn-41">41</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Comy.: "From the town of Pava it is three <i>gavutas</i> (approx. five miles) to Kusinara. Walking that distance with great effort and sitting down at twenty-five places on the way, the Blessed One reached the Sala Grove at dusk when the sun had already set. Thus comes illness to man, crushing all his health. As if he wanted to point to this fact, the Blessed One spoke those words which deeply moved the whole world: 'I am weary, Ananda, and want to lie down.'"</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-49" id="fn-49">49</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Paccekabuddha</i> is one awakened or enlightened for himself alone. Such Paccekabuddhas arise at times when there is no Fully Enlightened One <i>(samma-sambuddha).</i> Like the latter, they attain to Enlightenment by their own effort, but unlike them are not able to lead others to deliverance. See Ria Kloppenberg, <i>The Paccekabuddha: A Buddhist Ascetic</i> (BPS Wheel No. 305/307).</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-50" id="fn-50">50</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The word <i>vihara,</i> given in the text, cannot refer here to a monastery or monks' living quarters. Comy. explains it as a pavilion <i>(mandala-mala).</i> If the locality was used as a meeting place for the clan, as Comy. states, there may well have been a kind of shelter there. The couch in the open, which Ananda was asked to prepare for the Master, was probably a seat for the chiefs of the Malla clan put up at that place.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-51" id="fn-51">51</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Sekha.</i> This signifies those at the three lower stages of emancipation, before reaching arahatship. Ananda, at that time, had reached the first of these stages, stream-entry.</dd>

	<dd>The "seven jewels" of a universal monarch are: the magical wheel, emblem of his sovereignty, by which he conquers the earth without the use of force; his wonderful elephant; his horse; his beautiful wife; his precious gem; his treasurer; and his advisor.

<dt><a href="#fnt-56" id="fn-56">56</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Since Ananda, at this point, did not ask what the minor rules were, the Sangha decided not to abolish any of the rules of the Vinaya.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-57" id="fn-57">57</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Channa had been the Buddha's charioteer while the latter was still a prince living in the palace. Because of his prior connection with the Buddha, he was obdurate and refused to submit to discipline. This imposition of the "higher penalty" <i>(brahmadanda)</i> changed him into an obedient monk.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-58" id="fn-58">58</a>.</dt>
	<dd><i>Handa dani bhikkhave amantayami vo: Vayadhamma sankhara appamadena sampadetha.</i> Earnestness <i>(appamada)</i> is explained as "presence of mindfulness." Comy.: "'You should accomplish all your duties without allowing mindfulness to lapse!' Thus did the Blessed One, while on the bed of his Parinibbana, summarize in that one word on earnestness the advice he had given through forty-five years."</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-59" id="fn-59">59</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Anuruddha, the elder brother of Ananda, would have known this through the super-normal power of reading the minds of others, which he possessed.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-60" id="fn-60">60</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Brahma Sahampati was a high divinity of the Brahma-world. It was he who originally requested the newly enlightened Buddha to teach the Dhamma to the world. See MN 26.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-61" id="fn-61">61</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Sakka is the king of the gods in the Tavatimsa heaven, and thus a lower figure in the cosmological hierarchy than Brahma Sahampati.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-62" id="fn-62">62</a>.</dt>
	<dd>A celestial flower which appears on earth only on special occasions, particularly in connection with the chief events in the life of the Buddha. Its appearance in the hands of the Ajivaka ascetic signaled to the Venerable Maha Kassapa that the Buddha's Parinibbana had already taken place. (See below, Section 26.)</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-63" id="fn-63">63</a>.</dt>
	<dd>He was one of the foremost disciples of the Buddha and became the president of the First Great Council held shortly after the Buddha's Parinibbana. See Helmuth Hecker, <i>Maha Kassapa: Father of the Sangha</i> (BPS Wheel No. 345).</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-64" id="fn-64">64</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This Subhadda is a different person from the wanderer Subhadda who became the Buddha's last personal disciple.</dd>

[SUMMARY]={This wide-ranging sutta, the longest one in the Pali canon, describes the events leading up to, during, and immediately following the death and final release <i>(parinibbana)</i> of the Buddha. This colorful narrative contains a wealth of Dhamma teachings, including the Buddha's final instructions that defined how Buddhism would be lived and practiced long after the Buddha's death &mdash; even to this day. But this sutta also depicts, in simple language, the poignant human drama that unfolds among the Buddha's many devoted followers around the time of the death of their beloved teacher.}

<h1><a id='chap5'>5.</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h1>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to <a id="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a>: "Ananda, let's go to the far shore of the <a id="hirannavati">Hira&ntilde;&ntilde;avati River</a>. We'll head for <a id="upavattana">Upavattana</a>, the <a id="mallans">Mallans</a>' sal-grove near <a id="kusinara">Kusinara</a>."</p>

<p>"As you say, lord," Ven. Ananda responded to the Blessed One.</p>

<p><a id="sal">Then the</a> Blessed One with a large community of monks went to the far shore of the Hira&ntilde;&ntilde;avati River and headed for Upavattana, the Mallans' sal-grove near Kusinara. On arrival, he said to Ven. Ananda, "Ananda, please prepare a bed for me between the twin sal-trees, with its head to the north. I am tired, and will lie down."</p>

<p>Responding, "As you say, lord," Ven. Ananda prepared a bed between the twin sal-trees, with its head to the north. Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lion's sleeping posture, with one foot on top of the other, mindful &amp; alert.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a></p>

<p>Now at that time the twin sal-trees were in full bloom, even though it was not the time for flowering. They showered, strewed, &amp; sprinkled on the Tathagata's body in homage to him. Heavenly coral-tree blossoms fell from the sky, showering, strewing, &amp; sprinkling the Tathagata's body in homage to him. Heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky, showering, strewing, &amp; sprinkling the Tathagata's body in homage to him. Heavenly music was playing in the sky, in homage to the Tathagata. Heavenly songs were sung in the sky, in homage to the Tathagata.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda, "Ananda, the twin sal-trees are in full bloom, even though it's not the flowering season. They shower, strew, &amp; sprinkle on the Tathagata's body in homage to him. Heavenly coral-tree blossoms are falling from the sky... Heavenly sandalwood powder is falling from the sky... Heavenly music is playing in the sky... Heavenly songs are sung in the sky, in homage to the Tathagata. But it is not to this extent that a Tathagata is worshipped, honored, respected, venerated, or paid homage to. Rather, the monk, nun, male lay follower, or female lay follower who keeps practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, who keeps practicing masterfully, who lives in accordance with the Dhamma: that is the person who worships, honors, respects, venerates, &amp; pays homage to the Tathagata with the highest homage. So you should train yourselves: 'We will keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, we will keep practicing masterfully, we will live in accordance with the Dhamma.'<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> That's how you should train yourselves."</p>

<p>Now at that time <a id="upavana">Ven. Upavana</a> was standing in front of the Blessed One, fanning him. Then the Blessed One dismissed him, saying, "Go away, monk. Don't stand in front of me." Then the thought occurred to Ven. Ananda, "For a long time, now, this Ven. Upavana has been an attendant to the Blessed One, staying near him and traveling with him. But now, in his final hour, he dismisses him, saying, 'Go away, monk. Don't stand in front of me.' Now what is the reason, what is the cause, why the Blessed One dismisses him, saying, 'Go away, monk. Don't stand in front of me'?"</p>

<p>Then Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "For a long time, now, this Ven. Upavana has been an attendant to the Blessed One, staying near him and traveling with him. But now, in his final hour, he dismisses him, saying, 'Go away, monk. Don't stand in front of me.' Now what is the reason, what is the cause, why the Blessed One dismisses him, saying, 'Go away, monk. Don't stand in front of me'?"</p>

<p>"Ananda, most of the devatas from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Tathagata. For twelve leagues all around Upavattana, the Mallans' sal-grove near Kusinara, there is not the space even of the tip of a horse-tail hair that is not occupied by eminent devatas. The devatas, Ananda, are complaining, 'We have come a long distance to see the Tathagata.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> Only once in a long, long time does a Tathagata &mdash; worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened &mdash; arise in the world. Tonight, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occur. And this eminent monk is standing in front of the Blessed One, blocking the way. We aren't getting to see the Blessed One in his final hour.'"</p>

<p>"But, lord, what is the state of the devatas the Blessed One is referring to?"</p>

<p>"Ananda, there are devatas who perceive space to be earth. Tearing at their hair, they are weeping. Uplifting their arms, they are weeping. As if their feet were cut out from under them,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4'>[4]</a> they fall down and roll back &amp; forth, crying, 'All too soon, the Blessed One will be totally unbound! All too soon, the One Well-gone will be totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes (alternate reading: the Eye) will disappear from the world!' Then there are devatas who perceive earth to be earth. Tearing at their hair, they are weeping. Uplifting their arms, they are weeping. As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fall down and roll back &amp; forth, crying, 'All too soon, the Blessed One will be totally unbound! All too soon, the One Well-gone will be totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes will disappear from the world!' But those devatas who are free from passion acquiesce, mindful &amp; alert: 'Fabrications are inconstant. What else is there to expect?'"</p>

<p>"In the past, lord, the monks in all directions, after ending the Rains retreat, came to see the Tathagata. Thus we got to see &amp; attend to the monks who inspire the heart. But now, after the Blessed One is gone, we won't get to see or attend to the monks who inspire the heart."</p>

<p>"<a id="pilgrim">Ananda</a>, there are these four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction, that merit his feelings of urgency &amp; dismay <i>(samvega).</i> Which four? 'Here the Tathagata was born' is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction, that merits his feelings of urgency &amp; dismay. 'Here the Tathagata awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening'... 'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma'... 'Here the Tathagata was totally unbound in the remainderless property of Unbinding' is a place that merits being seen by a clansman with conviction, that merits his feelings of urgency &amp; dismay. These are the four places that merit being seen by a clansman with conviction, that merit his feelings of urgency &amp; dismay. They will come out of conviction, Ananda &mdash; monks, nuns, male lay followers, &amp; female lay followers &mdash; to the spots where 'Here the Tathagata was born,' 'Here the Tathagata awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening,' 'Here the Tathagata set rolling the unexcelled wheel of Dhamma,' 'Here the Tathagata was totally unbound in the remainderless property of Unbinding.' And anyone who dies while making a pilgrimage to these memorials with a bright, confident mind will &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death &mdash; reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>

<p>"Lord, what course should we follow with regard to womenfolk?"</p>

<p>"Not-seeing, Ananda"</p>

<p>"But when there is seeing, lord, what course should be followed?"</p>

<p>"Not-addressing, Ananda."</p>

<p>"But when we are addressed, what course should be followed?"</p>

<p>"Mindfulness should be established, Ananda."</p>

<p>"And, lord, what course should we follow with regard to the Tathagata's body?"</p>

<p>"You are not to be concerned about the Tathagata's funeral. Please, Ananda, strive for the true goal, be committed to the true goal, dwell heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute for the sake of the true goal. There are wise nobles, brahmans, &amp; householders who are highly confident in the Tathagata. They will conduct the Tathagata's funeral."</p>

<p>"But, lord, what course should be followed with regard to the Tathagata's body?"</p>

<p>"The course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel-turning monarch, Ananda, is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the Tathagata."</p>

<p>"And what, lord, is the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel-turning monarch?"</p>

<p>"Ananda, they wrap the body of a wheel-turning monarch in new linen cloth. Having wrapped it in new linen cloth, they wrap it in teased cotton-wool. Having wrapped it in teased cotton-wool, they wrap it in new linen cloth. Having done this 500 times, they place the body in an iron oil-vat, cover it with an iron lid, make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances, and cremate the body. Then they build a burial mound for the wheel-turning monarch at a great four-way intersection. That is the course that they follow with regard to the body of a wheel-turning monarch. The course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel-turning monarch, Ananda, is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the Tathagata. A burial mound for the Tathagata is to be built at a great four-way intersection. And those who offer a garland, a scent, or a perfume powder there, or bow down there, or brighten their minds there: that will be for their long-term welfare &amp; happiness.</p>

<p>"<a id="mound">There are</a> these four who are worthy of a burial mound. Which four? A Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, is worthy of a burial mound. A Private Buddha... a disciple of a Tathagata... a wheel-turning monarch is worthy of a burial mound.</p>

<p>"And for what reason is a Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, worthy of a burial mound? [At the thought,] 'This is the burial mound of a Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened,' many people will brighten their minds. Having brightened their minds there, then &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death &mdash; they will reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world. It is for this reason that a Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, is worthy of a burial mound.</p>

<p>"And for what reason is a Private Buddha worthy of a burial mound? [At the thought,] 'This is the burial mound of a Private Buddha,' many people will brighten their minds. Having brightened their minds there, then &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death &mdash; they will reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world...</p>

<p>"And for what reason is a disciple of a Tathagata worthy of a burial mound? [At the thought,] 'This is the burial mound of a disciple of a Tathagata,' many people will brighten their minds. Having brightened their minds there, then &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death &mdash; they will reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world...</p>

<p>"And for what reason is a wheel-turning monarch worthy of a burial mound? [At the thought,] 'This is the burial mound of a wheel-turning monarch,' many people will brighten their minds. Having brightened their minds there, then &mdash; on the break-up of the body, after death &mdash; they will reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world. It is for this reason that a wheel-turning monarch is worthy of a burial mound.</p>

<p>"These are the four who are worthy of a burial mound."</p>

<p>Then Ven. Ananda, going into a [nearby] building, stood leaning against the door jamb, weeping: "Here I am, still in training, with work left to do, and the total Unbinding of my teacher is about to occur &mdash; the teacher who has had such sympathy for me!"</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One said to the monks, "Monks, where is Ananda?"</p>

<p>"Lord, Ven. Ananda, having gone into that building, stands leaning against the door jamb, weeping: 'Here I am, still in training, with work left to do, and the total Unbinding of my teacher is about to occur &mdash; the teacher who has had such sympathy for me!'"</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, "Come, monk. In my name, call Ananda, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'"</p>

<p>"As you say, lord," the monk answered and, having gone to Ven. Ananda, on arrival he said, "The Teacher calls you, my friend."</p>

<p>"As you say, my friend," Ven. Ananda replied. Then he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Enough, Ananda. Don't grieve. Don't lament. Haven't I already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear &amp; appealing, the state of becoming separate, the state of becoming otherwise? What else is there to expect? It's impossible that one could forbid anything born, existent, fabricated, &amp; subject to disintegration from disintegrating.</p>

<p>"For a long time, Ananda, you have waited on the Tathagata with physical acts of good will &mdash; helpful, happy, whole-hearted, without limit; with verbal acts of good will... with mental acts of good will &mdash; helpful, happy, whole-hearted, without limit. You are one who has made merit. Commit yourself to exertion, and soon you will be without mental fermentations."</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Monks, those who, in the past, were worthy ones, rightly self-awakened, had foremost attendants, just as I have had Ananda. Those who, in the future, will be worthy ones, rightly self-awakened, will have foremost attendants, just as I have had Ananda. Ananda is wise, he knows, 'This is the time to approach to see the Tathagata. This is the time for monks, this the time for nuns, this the time for male lay-followers, this the time for female lay-followers, this the time for kings &amp; their ministers, this the time for sectarians, this the time for the followers of sectarians.'</p>

<p>"<a id="amazingananda">There are</a> these four marvelous &amp; amazing qualities in Ananda. If a group of monks approaches to see Ananda, they are gratified at the sight of him. If he speaks Dhamma to them, they are gratified with what he says. Before they are sated, he falls silent. If a group of nuns approaches to see Ananda... If a group of male lay followers approaches to see Ananda... If a group of female lay followers approaches to see Ananda, they are gratified at the sight of him. If he speaks Dhamma to them, they are gratified with what he says. Before they are sated, he falls silent. These are the four marvelous &amp; amazing qualities in Ananda. <a id="amazingmonarch">There are</a> these four marvelous &amp; amazing qualities in a wheel-turning monarch. If a group of noble warriors approaches to see him... If a group of brahmans approaches to see him... If a group of householders approaches to see him... If a group of contemplatives approaches to see him, they are gratified at the sight of him. If he speaks to them, they are gratified with what he says. Before they are sated, he falls silent. In the same way, monks, there are these four marvelous &amp; amazing qualities in Ananda. If a group of monks... a group of nuns... a group of male lay followers... a group of female lay followers approaches to see Ananda, they are gratified at the sight of him. If he speaks Dhamma to them, they are gratified with what he says. Before they are sated, he falls silent. These are the four marvelous &amp; amazing qualities in Ananda."</p>

<p>When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "Lord, may the Blessed One not be totally unbound in this little town, this dusty town, this branch township. There are other great cities: <a id="campa">Campa</a>, <a id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>, <a id="savatthi">Savatthi</a>, <a id="saketa">Saketa</a>, <a id="kosambi">Kosambi</a>, <a id="vanarasi">Vanarasi</a>. May the Blessed One be totally unbound there. In those cities there are many wealthy noble warriors, brahmans, &amp; householders who have high confidence in the Tathagata. They will conduct the Tathagata's funeral."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that: 'this little town, this dusty town, this branch township.' In the past, Ananda, a king named <a id="mahasudassana">Mahasudassana</a> was a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king ruling righteously, who was a conqueror of the four directions, a stabilizer of his country, endowed with the seven treasures. This Kusinara was his capital city, named <a id="kusavati">Kusavati</a>: twelve leagues long from east to west, seven leagues wide from north to south. Kusavati was powerful, rich, &amp; well-populated, crowded with people &amp; prosperous. Just as the capital city of the devas, named <a id="alakamanda">Alakamanda</a> is powerful, rich, &amp; well-populated, crowded with yakkhas &amp; prosperous; in the same way, Kusavati was powerful, rich, &amp; well-populated, crowded with people &amp; prosperous. By day or by night, it was never lacking in ten sounds: the sound of elephants, horses, carts, drums, tabors, lutes, songs, cymbals, gongs, with cries of 'Eat! Drink! Snack!' as the tenth.</p>

<p>"Now, Ananda, go into Kusinara and announce to the Kusinara Mallans, 'Tonight, Vasitthas, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occur. Come out, Vasitthas! Come out, Vasitthas! Don't later regret that "The Tathagata's total Unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town, but we didn't get to see him in his final hour!"'"</p>

<p>Responding, "As you say, lord," Ven. Ananda put on his robe and &mdash; carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe &mdash; went unaccompanied into Kusinara. <a id="regret">Now</a> at that time the Kusinara Mallans had met for some business in their assembly hall. Ven. Ananda went to the assembly hall and on arrival announced to them, "Tonight, Vasitthas, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of the Tathagata will occur. Come out, Vasitthas! Come out, Vasitthas! Don't later regret that 'The Tathagata's total Unbinding occurred within the borders of our very own town, but we didn't get to see him in his final hour!'" When they heard Ven. Ananda, the Mallans together with their sons, daughters, &amp; wives were shocked, saddened, their minds overflowing with sorrow. Some of them wept, tearing at their hair; they wept, uplifting their arms. As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fell down and rolled back &amp; forth, crying, "All too soon, the Blessed One will be totally unbound! All too soon, the One Well-gone will be totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes will disappear from the world!"</p>

<p>Then the Mallans together with their sons, daughters, &amp; wives &mdash; shocked, saddened, their minds overflowing with sorrow &mdash; went to Ven. Ananda at Upavattana, the Mallans' sal-grove near Kusinara. The thought occurred to Ven. Ananda, "If I let the Mallans pay reverence to the Blessed One one by one, the night will be over before they have finished paying reverence. What if I were to have them pay reverence to the Blessed One arranging them family by family, announcing, 'Lord, the Mallan named so-&amp;-so, together with his children &amp; wives, servants &amp; retainers, bows down with his head at the Blessed One's feet.'"<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5'>[5]</a> So Ven. Ananda, arranging the Mallans family by family, had them pay reverence to the Blessed One, [saying,] "Lord, the Mallan named so-&amp;-so, together with his children &amp; wives, servants &amp; retainers, bows down with his head at the Blessed One's feet."</p>

<p>In this way Ven. Ananda got the Mallans to pay reverence to the Blessed One within the first watch of the night.</p>

<p>Now at that time <a id="subhadda">Subhadda</a> the Wanderer was staying in Kusinara. He heard, "Tonight, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will take place." Then the thought occurred to him: "I have heard the elder wanderers, teachers of teachers, saying that only once in a long, long time do Tathagatas &mdash; worthy ones, rightly self-awakened &mdash; appear in the world. Tonight, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occur. Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me, but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt."</p>

<p>So he went to Upavattana, the Mallans' sal-grove and, on arrival, said to Ven. Ananda, "I have heard the elder wanderers, teachers of teachers, saying that only once in a long, long time do Tathagatas &mdash; worthy ones, rightly self-awakened &mdash; appear in the world. Tonight, in the last watch of the night, the total Unbinding of Gotama the contemplative will occur. Now there is a doubt that has arisen in me, but I have faith that he could teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might abandon that doubt. It would be good, Ven. Ananda, if you would let me see him."</p>

<p>When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to him, "Enough, friend Subhadda. Don't bother the Blessed One. The Blessed One is tired."</p>

<p>For a second time... For a third time, Subhadda the Wanderer said to Ven. Ananda, "...It would be good, Ven. Ananda, if you would let me see him."</p>

<p>For a third time, Ven. Ananda said to him, "Enough, friend Subhadda. Don't bother the Blessed One. The Blessed One is tired."</p>

<p>Now, the Blessed One heard the exchange between Ven. Ananda &amp; Subhadda the Wanderer, and so he said to Ven. Ananda, "Enough, Ananda. Don't stand in his way. Let him see the Tathagata. Whatever he asks me will all be for the sake of knowledge, and not to be bothersome. And whatever I answer when asked, he will quickly understand."</p>

<p>So Ven. Ananda said to Subhadda the Wanderer, "Go ahead, friend Subhadda. The Blessed One gives you his leave."</p>

<p><a id="question">Then Subhadda</a> went to the Blessed One and exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Venerable sir, these brahmans &amp; contemplatives, each with his group, each with his community, each the teacher of his group, an honored leader, well-regarded by people at large &mdash; i.e., <a id="purana">Purana</a> Kassapa, <a id="makkhali">Makkhali</a> Gosala, <a id="ajita">Ajita</a> Kesakambalin, <a id="pakudha">Pakudha</a> Kaccayana, <a id="sanjaya">Sa&ntilde;jaya</a> Belatthaputta, &amp; the Nigantha <a id="nataputta">Nataputta</a>: Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim, or do they all not have direct knowledge, or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not?"</p>

<p>"Enough, Subhadda. Put this question aside. I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen, and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

<p><a id="eightfold">"Yes</a>, lord," Subhadda answered, and the Blessed One said, "In any doctrine &amp; discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found, no contemplative of the first... second... third... fourth order [stream-winner, once-returner, non-returner, or arahant] is found. But in any doctrine &amp; discipline where the noble eightfold path <i>is</i> found, contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order <i>are</i> found. The noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine &amp; discipline, and right here there are contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order. Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this world will not be empty of arahants."</p>

At age twenty-nine I went forth,

<p>"And no contemplative of the second... third... fourth order. Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this world will not be empty of arahants."</p>

<p>Then Subhadda the Wanderer said, "<a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point out the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One &mdash; through many lines of reasoning &mdash; made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. Let me obtain the going forth in the Blessed One's presence, let me obtain admission."</p>

<p>"Anyone, Subhadda, who has previously belonged to another sect and who desires the going forth &amp; admission in this doctrine &amp; discipline, must first undergo probation for four months. If, at the end of four months, the monks feel so moved, they give him the going forth &amp; admit him to the monk's state. But I know distinctions among individuals in this matter."</p>

<p>"Lord, if that is so, I am willing to undergo probation for four years. If, at the end of four years, the monks feel so moved, let them give me the going forth &amp; admit me to the monk's state."</p>

<p><a id="ordain">Then</a> the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda, "Very well then, Ananda, give Subhadda the going forth."</p>

<p>"Yes, lord," Ananda answered.</p>

<p>Then Subhadda said to Ven. Ananda, "It is a gain for you, Ananda, a great gain, that you have been anointed here in the Teacher's presence with the pupil's anointing."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-6' id='fnt-6'>[6]</a></p>

<p><a id="victory">Then Subhadda</a> the Wanderer received the going forth &amp; the admission in the Blessed One's presence. And not long after his admission &mdash; dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute &mdash; he in no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And thus Ven. Subhadda became another one of the arahants, the last of the Blessed One's face-to-face disciples.</p>

<h2><a id='chap6'>6.</a>&nbsp;<a title='Go to top of page' class='back' href='#top'>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p><a id="dhamma-vinaya">Then</a> the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda, "Now, if it occurs to any of you &mdash; 'The teaching has lost its authority; we are without a Teacher' &mdash; do not view it in that way. Whatever Dhamma &amp; Vinaya I have pointed out &amp; formulated for you, that will be your Teacher when I am gone.</p>

<p>"At present, the monks address one another as 'friend,' but after I am gone they are not to address one another that way. The more senior monks are to address the newer monks by their name or clan or as 'friend.' The newer monks are to address the more senior monks as 'venerable' or 'sir.'</p>

<p>"After I am gone, the sangha &mdash; if it wants &mdash; may abolish the lesser &amp; minor training rules.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-7' id='fnt-7'>[7]</a></p>

<p>"After I am gone, the monk <a id="channa">Channa</a> should be given the brahma penalty."</p>

<p>"What, lord, is the brahma penalty?"</p>

<p>"Channa may say what he wants, Ananda, but he is not to be spoken to, instructed, or admonished by the monks."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8' id='fnt-8'>[8]</a></p>

<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, "If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha, the path or the practice, ask. Don't later regret that 'The Teacher was face-to-face with us, but we didn't bring ourselves to cross-question him in his presence.'"</p>

<p>When this was said, the monks were silent.</p>

<p>A second time, the Blessed One said, "If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha, the path or the practice, ask. Don't later regret that 'The Teacher was face-to-face with us, but we didn't bring ourselves to cross-question him in his presence.'"</p>

<p>A second time, the monks were silent.</p>

<p>A third time, the Blessed One said, "If even a single monk has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha, the path or the practice, ask. Don't later regret that 'The Teacher was face-to-face with us, but we didn't bring ourselves to cross-question him in his presence.'"</p>

<p>A third time, the monks were silent.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Now, if it's out of respect for the Teacher that you don't ask, let a friend inform a friend."</p>

<p>When this was said, the monks were silent.</p>

<p>Then Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "It's amazing, lord. It's marvelous. I'm confident that, in this community of monks, there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha, the path or the practice."</p>

<p>"You, Ananda, speak out of confidence, while there is knowledge in the Tathagata that, in this community of monks, there is not even a single monk who has any doubt or perplexity concerning the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha, the path or the practice. Of these 500 monks, the most backward is a stream-winner, not destined for the planes of deprivation, headed to self-awakening for sure."</p>

<p><a id="lastword">Then</a> the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Now, then, monks, I exhort you: All fabrications are subject to decay. Bring about completion by being heedful." Those were the Tathagata's last words.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One entered the first jhana. Emerging from that he entered the second jhana. Emerging from that, he entered the third... the fourth jhana... the dimension of the infinitude of space... the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness... the dimension of nothingness... the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he entered the cessation of perception &amp; feeling.</p>

<p>Then Ven. Ananda said to <a id="anuruddha">Ven. Anuruddha</a>, "Ven. Anuruddha,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-9' id='fnt-9'>[9]</a> the Blessed One is totally unbound."</p>

<p>"No, friend Ananda. The Blessed One isn't totally unbound. He has entered the cessation of perception &amp; feeling."</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One, emerging from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he entered the dimension of nothingness... the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness... the dimension of the infinitude of space... the fourth jhana... the third... the second... the first jhana. Emerging from the first jhana he entered the second... the third... the fourth jhana. Emerging from the fourth jhana, he immediately was totally Unbound.</p>

<p>When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total Unbinding, there was a great earthquake, awesome &amp; hair-raising, and the drums of the devas sounded.</p>

<p>When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total Unbinding, <a id="sahampati">Sahampati Brahma</a> uttered this verse:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
All beings  &mdash;  all  &mdash;  in the world,
will cast off the bodily heap
	in the world
where a Teacher like this
without peer in the world
the Tathagata, with strength attained,
the Rightly Self-Awakened One,
	has been totally
	Unbound.
</div>

<p>When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total Unbinding, <a id="sakka">Sakka</a>, ruler of the gods, uttered this verse:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
How inconstant are compounded things!
Their nature:   to arise &amp; pass away.
They disband    as they are arising.
	Their total stilling is bliss.
</div>

<p>When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total Unbinding, Ven. Anuruddha uttered this verse:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
He had no in-&amp;-out breathing,
the one who was Such, the firm-minded one,
	imperturbable
	&amp; bent on peace:
	the sage completing his span.

With heart unbowed
	he endured the pain.
Like a flame's unbinding
	was the liberation
	   of awareness.
</div>

<p>When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total Unbinding, Ven. Ananda uttered this verse:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
It was awe-inspiring.
It was hair-raising
when,   displaying the foremost
	   accomplishment in all things,
the Rightly Self-Awakened One
was totally Unbound.
</div>

<p>When the Blessed One was totally Unbound, simultaneously with the total Unbinding, some of the monks present who were not without passion wept, uplifting their arms. As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fell down and rolled back &amp; forth, crying, "All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound! All too soon is the One Well-gone totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world!" But those monks who were free from passion acquiesced, mindful &amp; alert: "Fabrications are inconstant. What else is there to expect?"</p>

<p>Then Ven. Anuruddha addressed the monks, "Enough, friends. Don't grieve. Don't lament. Hasn't the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear &amp; appealing, the state of becoming separate, the state of becoming otherwise? What else is there to expect? It's impossible that one could forbid anything born, existent, fabricated, &amp; subject to disintegration from disintegrating. The devatas, friends, are complaining."</p>

<p>[Ananda:] "But, Ven. Anuruddha, what is the state of the devatas the Blessed One is referring to?"</p>

<p>"Friend Ananda, there are devatas who perceive space to be earth. Tearing at their hair, they are weeping. Uplifting their arms, they are weeping. As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fall down and roll back &amp; forth, crying, 'All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound! All too soon is the One Well-gone totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world!' Then there are devatas who perceive earth to be earth. Tearing at their hair, they are weeping. Uplifting their arms, they are weeping. As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fall down and roll back &amp; forth, crying, 'All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound! All too soon is the One Well-gone totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world!' But those devatas who are free from passion acquiesce, mindful &amp; alert: 'Fabrications are inconstant. What else is there to expect?'"</p>

<p>Then Ven. Anuruddha &amp; Ven. Ananda spent the remainder of the night in Dhamma talk.</p>

<p>Then Ven. Anuruddha said to Ven. Ananda, "Go, friend Ananda. Entering Kusinara, announce to the Kusinara Mallans, 'The Blessed One, Vasitthas, is totally unbound. Now is the time for you to do as you see fit.'"</p>

<p>Responding, "As you say, sir," Ven. Ananda in the early morning put on his robe and &mdash; carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe &mdash; went unaccompanied into Kusinara. Now at that time the Kusinara Mallans had met for some business in their assembly hall. Ven. Ananda went to the assembly hall and on arrival announced to them, "The Blessed One, Vasitthas, is totally unbound. Now is the time for you to do as you see fit."</p>

<p>When they heard Ven. Ananda, the Mallans together with their sons, daughters, &amp; wives were shocked, saddened, their minds overflowing with sorrow. Some of them wept, tearing at their hair; they wept, uplifting their arms. As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fell down and rolled back &amp; forth, crying, "All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound! All too soon is the One Well-gone totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world!"</p>

<p>Then the Kusinara Mallans ordered their men, "In that case, I say, gather scents, garlands, &amp; all the musical instruments in Kusinara!" Then, taking scents, garlands, &amp; all the musical instruments in Kusinara, along with 500 lengths of cloth, the Kusinara Mallans went to the Blessed One's body in Upavattana, the Mallans' sal-grove near Kusinara. On arrival, they spent the entire day in worshipping, honoring, respecting, &amp; venerating the Blessed One's body with dances, songs, music, garlands, &amp; scents, in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreaths. Then the thought occurred to them, "It's too late today to cremate the Blessed One's body. We'll cremate the Blessed One's body tomorrow." And so they spent the second day, the third day, the fourth day, the fifth day, the sixth day in worshipping, honoring, respecting, &amp; venerating the Blessed One's body with dances, songs, music, garlands, &amp; scents, in making cloth canopies and arranging floral wreaths.</p>

<p>Then on the seventh day the thought occurred to them, "Worshipping, honoring, respecting, &amp; venerating to the Blessed One's body with dances, songs, music, garlands, &amp; scents, let's carry it to the south, around the outside of the town, and cremate it to the south of the town."</p>

<p>Then eight leading Mallans, having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth, thinking, "We'll lift up the Blessed One's body," were unable to lift it. So the Kusinara Mallans asked Ven. Anuruddha, "What is the reason, Ven. Anuruddha, what is the cause, why these eight leading Mallans, having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth, thinking, 'We'll lift up the Blessed One's body,' are unable to lift it?"</p>

<p>"Your intention, Vasitthas, is one thing. The devas' intention is another."</p>

<p>"But what, Ven. Anuruddha, is the devas' intention?"</p>

<p>"Your intention, Vasitthas, is, 'Worshipping, honoring, respecting, &amp; venerating the Blessed One's body with dances, songs, music, garlands, &amp; scents, let's carry it to the south, around the outside of the town, and cremate it to the south of the town.' The devas' intention is, 'Worshipping, honoring, respecting, &amp; venerating the Blessed One's body with heavenly dances, songs, music, garlands, &amp; scents, let's carry it to the north of the town, enter the town through the north gate, carry it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans' memorial called <a id="makuta">Makuta-bandhana</a>, to cremate it there.'"</p>

<p>"Then let it be, venerable sir, in line with the devas' intention."</p>

<p>Now at that time Kusinara &mdash; even to its rubbish heaps &amp; cesspools &mdash; was strewn knee-deep in coral-tree flowers. So the devas &amp; the Kusinara Mallans, worshipping, honoring, respecting, &amp; venerating the Blessed One's body with heavenly &amp; human dances, songs, music, garlands, &amp; scents, carried it to the north of the town, entered the town through the north gate, carried it through the middle of the town and out the east gate to the Mallans' memorial called Makuta-bandhana. There they set it down.</p>

<p>Then the Kusinara Mallans said to Ven. Ananda, "Venerable sir, what course should we follow with regard to the Tathagata's body?"</p>

<p>"The course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel-turning monarch, Vasitthas, is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the Tathagata."</p>

<p>"And what, venerable sir, is the course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel-turning monarch?"</p>

<p>"Vasitthas, they wrap the body of a wheel-turning monarch in new linen cloth. Having wrapped it in new linen cloth, they wrap it in teased cotton-wool. Having wrapped it in teased cotton-wool, they wrap it in new linen cloth. Having done this 500 times, they place the body in an iron oil-vat, cover it with an iron lid, make a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances, and cremate the body. Then they build a burial mound for the wheel-turning monarch at a great four-way intersection. That is the course that they follow with regard to the body of a wheel-turning monarch. The course they follow with regard to the body of a wheel-turning monarch, Vasitthas, is the course that should be followed with regard to the body of the Tathagata. A burial mound for the Tathagata is to be built at a great, four-way intersection. And those who offer a garland, a scent, or a perfume powder there, or bow down there, or brighten their minds there: that will be for their long-term welfare &amp; happiness."</p>

<p>So the Kusinara Mallans ordered their men, "In that case, I say, gather the Mallans' teased cotton-wool."</p>

<p>Then they wrapped the Blessed One's body in new linen cloth. Having wrapped it in new linen cloth, they wrapped it in teased cotton-wool. Having wrapped it in teased cotton-wool, they wrapped it in new linen cloth. Having done this 500 times, they placed the body in an iron oil-vat, covered it with an iron lid, made a pyre composed totally of perfumed substances, and set the body on the pyre.</p>

<p>Now at that time <a id="kassapa">Ven. Maha Kassapa</a> was traveling on the highway from <a id="pava">Pava</a> to Kusinara with a large community of monks, approximately 500 monks in all. Leaving the road, he sat down at the foot of a tree. Meanwhile, a certain naked ascetic, carrying a coral-tree flower from Kusinara, was traveling on the highway to Pava. Ven. Maha Kassapa saw the naked ascetic coming from afar, and on seeing him said to him, "Do you know our teacher, friend?"</p>

<p>"Yes, friend, I know him. Seven days ago Gotama the contemplative was totally unbound. That's how I got this coral-tree flower."</p>

<p>With that, some of the monks present who were not without passion wept, uplifting their arms. As if their feet were cut out from under them, they fell down and rolled back &amp; forth, crying, "All too soon is the Blessed One totally unbound! All too soon is the One Well-gone totally unbound! All too soon, the One with Eyes has disappeared from the world!" But those monks who were free from passion acquiesced, mindful &amp; alert: "Fabrications are inconstant. What else is there to expect?"</p>

<p>Now at that time a monk named <a id="subhadda2">Subhadda</a><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-10' id='fnt-10'>[10]</a> who had gone forth when old was sitting among the group. He said to the monks, "Enough, friends. Don't grieve. Don't lament. We're well rid of the Great Contemplative. We've been harassed by [his saying], 'This is allowable. This is not allowable.' But now we will do what we want to do, and not do what we don't want to do."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-11' id='fnt-11'>[11]</a></p>

<p>Then Ven. Maha Kassapa addressed the monks, "Enough, friends. Don't grieve. Don't lament. Hasn't the Blessed One already taught the state of growing different with regard to all things dear &amp; appealing, the state of becoming separate, the state of becoming otherwise? What else is there to expect? It's impossible that one could forbid anything born, existent, fabricated, &amp; subject to disintegration from disintegrating."</p>

<p>Then four leading Mallans, having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth, thinking, "We'll ignite the Blessed One's pyre," were unable to ignite it. So the Kusinara Mallans asked Ven. Anuruddha, "What is the reason, Ven. Anuruddha, what is the cause, why these four leading Mallans, having bathed their heads and wearing new linen cloth, thinking, 'We'll ignite the Blessed One's pyre,' are unable to ignite it?"</p>

<p>"Your intention, Vasitthas, is one thing. The devas' intention is another."</p>

<p>"But what, Ven. Anuruddha, is the devas' intention?"</p>

<p>"The devas' intention, Vasitthas, is, 'This Ven. Maha Kassapa is traveling on the highway from Pava to Kusinara with a large community of monks, approximately 500 monks in all. The Blessed One's pyre will not catch fire until Ven. Maha Kassapa has worshipped the Blessed One's feet with his head.'"</p>

<p>"Then let it be, venerable sir, in line with the devas' intention."</p>

<p><a id="relics">So Ven</a>. Maha Kassapa went to the Blessed One's pyre at Makuta-bandhana, the Mallans' memorial near Kusinara. On arrival, arranging his robe over one shoulder, he placed his hands palm-to-palm over his heart, circumambulated the pyre, uncovered the Blessed One's feet,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-12' id='fnt-12'>[12]</a> and worshipped them with his head. And the 500 monks, arranging their robes over one shoulder, placed their hands palm-to-palm over their hearts, circumambulated the pyre, and worshipped the Blessed One's feet with their heads. As soon as it had been worshipped by Ven. Maha Kassapa and the 500 monks, the Blessed One's pyre caught fire of its own accord. In the burning of the Blessed One's body, no cinder or ash of the outer skin, inner skin, flesh, tendons, or oil of the joints could be discerned. Only the bone-relics<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-13' id='fnt-13'>[13]</a> remained. Just as in the burning of ghee or oil, no cinder or ash can be discerned; in the same way, in the burning of the Blessed One's body, no cinder or ash of the outer skin, inner skin, flesh, tendons, or oil of the joints could be discerned. Only the bone-relics remained. And of the 500 twin-wrappings only two were burnt: the innermost &amp; the outermost.</p>

<p>When the Blessed One's body was consumed, a cascade of water fell from the sky, extinguishing the Blessed One's pyre. Water shot up from a sal-tree as well, extinguishing the Blessed One's pyre. The Kusinara Mallans, with all kinds of scented water, extinguished the Blessed One's pyre. Then for seven days they kept the bone-relics in their assembly hall &mdash; setting them round with a lattice of spears surrounded by ramparts of bows &mdash; worshipping, honoring, respecting, &amp; venerating them with dances, songs, music, garlands, &amp; scents.</p>

<p>Then <a id="aja">King Ajatasattu</a> Vedehiputta of Magadha heard, "The Blessed One, they say, has been totally unbound in Kusinara." So he sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans: "The Blessed One was a noble warrior. I, too, am a noble warrior. I deserve a share of the Blessed One's bone-relics. I, too, will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them."</p>

<p>The <a id="licchavi">Licchavis</a> of <a id="vesali">Vesali</a> heard, "The Blessed One, they say, has been totally unbound in Kusinara." So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans: "The Blessed One was a noble warrior. We, too, are noble warriors. We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bone-relics. We, too, will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them."</p>

<p>The <a id="sakyan">Sakyans</a> of <a id="kapilavattu">Kapilavatthu</a> heard, "The Blessed One, they say, has been totally unbound in Kusinara." So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans: "The Blessed One was the greatest of our relatives. We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bone-relics. We, too, will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them."</p>

<p>The <a id="buliyan">Buliyans</a> of <a id="allakappa">Allakappa</a>... The <a id="koliyan">Koliyans</a> of <a id="ramagama">Ramagama</a> heard, "The Blessed One, they say, has been totally unbound in Kusinara." So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans: "The Blessed One was a noble warrior. We, too, are noble warriors. We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bone-relics. We, too, will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them."</p>

<p>The Brahman of <a id="vetha">Vetha Island</a> heard, "The Blessed One, they say, has been totally unbound in Kusinara." So he sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans: "The Blessed One was a noble warrior. I am a brahman. I deserve a share of the Blessed One's bone-relics. I, too, will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them."</p>

<p>The Pava Mallans heard, "The Blessed One, they say, has been totally unbound in Kusinara." So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans: "The Blessed One was a noble warrior. We, too, are noble warriors. We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bone-relics. We, too, will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them."</p>

<p>When this was said, the Kusinara Mallans said to the groups &amp; factions, "The Blessed One was totally unbound within the borders of our own town. We will not give up a share of the Blessed One's bone-relics."</p>

<p>When this was said, <a id="dona">Dona</a> the brahman addressed the groups &amp; factions,</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Listen, good sirs,
to a word from me.
Our Awakened One taught
	forbearance.
It's not good that there should be combat
over the relics of the highest one.
Let's unite in concord,
	on friendly terms,
and make eight shares.
Let there be
	burial mounds
	in the various directions,
	many people made confident
	in the One with Eyes.
</div>

<p>"In that case, brahman, you yourself divide the Blessed One's bone-relics into eight equal shares."</p>

<p>Responding, "As you say, good sirs," to the groups &amp; factions, Dona the brahman divided the Blessed One's bone-relics into eight equal shares and then said to the groups &amp; factions, "Good sirs, give me this urn. I will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for the urn." They gave him the urn.</p>

<p>Then the <a id="moriyans">Moriyans</a> of <a id="pipphalivana">Pipphalivana</a> heard, "The Blessed One, they say, has been totally unbound in Kusinara." So they sent an envoy to the Kusinara Mallans: "The Blessed One was a noble warrior. We, too, are noble warriors. We deserve a share of the Blessed One's bone-relics. We, too, will build a burial mound and hold a ceremony for them."</p>

<p>"There is no [remaining] share of the Blessed One's bone-relics. They have been divided. Take the embers from here." They took the embers from there.</p>

<p>Then King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Rajagaha.</p>

<p>The Licchavis of Vesali built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Vesali.</p>

<p>The Sakyans of Kapilavattu built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Kapilavattu.</p>

<p>The Buliyans of Allakappa built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Allakappa.</p>

<p>The Koliyans of Ramagama built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Ramagama.</p>

<p>The brahman of Vettha Island built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics on Vettha Island.</p>

<p>The Pava Mallans built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Pava.</p>

<p>The Kusinara Mallans built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the Blessed One's relics in Kusinara.</p>

<p>Dona the brahman built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the urn.</p>

<p>The Moriyans of Pipphalivana built a burial mound and held a ceremony for the embers in Pipphalivana.</p>

<p>Thus there were eight burial mounds for the bone-relics, a ninth for the urn, and a tenth for the embers.</p>

<p>That is how it was in the past.</p>


<div class='freeverse'>
Eight portions were the relics
of the One with Vision,
the highest, the foremost of men:
	seven honored in Jambudipa,
	and one in Ramagama
	honored by kings of the nagas.
One tooth the devas of the Thirty-three worship;
one is honored in Gandharapura;
one in the realm of the king of Kalinga;
another is honored by kings of the nagas.

These, with their splendor, their excellent gifts,
embellish this wealth-bearing earth.

Thus the relics of the One with Vision
	are honored by those honored
	by those who are honored.
He is worshiped by deva kings,
naga kings, human kings,

So pay homage to him,

	<dd>In preceding sections of the discourse, the standard phrase describing the Buddha's act of lying down to rest reads, "Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side in the lion's sleeping posture, with one foot on top of the other, mindful &amp; alert, having made a mental note to get up." Here, however, the Buddha is lying down for the last time and will pass away in this posture, so he makes no mental note to get up.</dd>

	<dd><a href="../sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html">SN 12.67</a> states: "If a monk practices for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, &amp; cessation with regard to aging &amp; death... birth... becoming... clinging/sustenance... craving... feeling... contact... the six sense media... name &amp; form... consciousness... fabrications... ignorance, he deserves to be called a monk who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma."</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-3" id="fn-3">3</a>.</dt>
	<dd>From Vedic times, it has been considered auspicious in India to gaze on a holy person or heavenly being, and to be gazed on by such a being as well. Here the fact that heavenly beings themselves want to gaze on the Buddha indicates the high regard they have for him (this is also the motive for their Great Meeting in <a href="dn.20.0.than.html">DN 20</a>); the phrase later in this paragraph, "the One with Eyes," indicates that they also regarded his gaze as highly auspicious for them. Later passages in this discourse indicate that human beings have similar feelings about the auspiciousness of the Buddha's gaze and the Buddha as an object of one's own gaze. A great deal of the later history of Buddhism in India &mdash; including devotional practice, Buddhology, meditation practice, and even the architecture of monasteries &mdash; grew out of the continuing desire to have a vision of the Buddha and to be gazed on by the Buddha, even after his Parinibbana.
	<p>It is sometimes assumed, based on a passage in SN 22.87, that the Pali canon is uniformly negative toward this aspect of Buddhist tradition. There, Ven. Vakkali, who is ill, states that "For a long time have I wanted to come &amp; see the Blessed One, but I haven't had the bodily strength to do so," and the Buddha comforts him, "Enough, Vakkali. Why do you want to see this filthy body? Whoever sees the Dhamma sees me; whoever sees me sees the Dhamma." It should be noted, however, that the Buddha's treatment of this topic is sensitive to the context. In SN 22.87, he is talking to a monk who (1) is too sick to come see the Buddha on his own strength; and (2) is on the verge of arahantship. Here in DN 16, however, the Buddha dismisses Ven. Upavana so as to honor the desire of the devas who want to see him in his last hour; and he sends Ven. Ananda into Kusinara to inform the lay people there so that they too will be able to see him in his last hour. His motive here may be similar to that given for encouraging the building of a burial mound dedicated to him: seeing him will help human &amp; heavenly beings brighten their minds, and that will be for their long-term welfare &amp; happiness. Thus the attitudes expressed on this topic in the Pali canon, when taken in their entirety, are more complex than is generally recognized.</p>

	<dd>The desire to have one's name announced to a holy person appears to have been a part of pre-Buddhist devotional practice in India. This passage, along with others in the Canon, indicates that it was quickly adopted into Buddhist devotional practice as well. It lived on in later Buddhist practice in the custom of having the donor's name inscribed in bas-reliefs placed near or on a stupa, even in locations where the name would not be visible to human eyes.</dd>

	<dd>The commentary notes that Subhadda makes this statement based on non-Buddhist practices he knew from his previous sectarian affiliation.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-7" id="fn-7">7</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The Cullavagga (XI.9) tells of how the monks at the First Council could not agree on which rules should be classed as lesser &amp; minor. Ven. Ananda himself confessed that he neglected to ask the Buddha on this point. One of the monks made a motion that &mdash; since many of the rules affect the laity, and the laity would look down on the monks for rescinding them after the Buddha's death &mdash; none of the rules should be rescinded. This motion was adopted by the Council.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-8" id="fn-8">8</a>.</dt>
	<dd>A monk named Channa is depicted at several spots in the Vinaya as despising all other monks on the grounds that "The Buddha is mine, the Dhamma is mine, it was by my young master that the Dhamma was realized." (<a href="../vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#sg-12">Sanghadisesa 12</a>) This would fit in with the post-canonical tradition identifying Channa as the horseman who accompanied the young Prince Siddhartha on the night of the latter's Great Renunciation. Two rules in the Vinaya &mdash; <a href="../vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#sg-12">Sanghadisesa 12</a> &amp; <a href="../vin/sv/bhikkhu-pati.html#pc-12">Pacittiya 12</a> &mdash; depict him as devious &amp; impossible to admonish. Cv.XI reports events after the Parinibbana, telling of how news of the brahma-penalty shocked Channa to his senses. As a result, he changed his ways and eventually became an arahant. As Ven. Ananda then explains in that passage, the brahma-penalty was automatically lifted at the moment of Ven. Channa's final attainment. <a href="../sn/sn22/sn22.090.than.html">SN 22.90</a> tells a different version of how Ven. Channa changed his attitude and broke through to the Dhamma.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-11" id="fn-11">11</a>.</dt>
	<dd>In Cullavagga XI.1, Ven. Maha Kassapa cites this statement as good reason to hold a council for standardizing the Dhamma &amp; Vinaya "before what is not-dhamma shines out and dhamma is obscured, before what is not-discipline shines out and discipline is obscured; before those who speak what is not-dhamma become strong and those who speak what is dhamma become weak; before those who speak what is not-discipline become strong and those who speak what is discipline become weak." Thus the First Council was held during the Rains Retreat following the Buddha's Parinibbana.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-12" id="fn-12">12</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The commentary notes that Ven. Maha Kassapa entered the fourth jhana, which he used as the basis for a feat of psychic power so that the Buddha's feet would appear out of their extensive wrappings.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-13" id="fn-13">13</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Up to this point in the narrative, the Buddha's body is called a <i>sarira</i> (singular). Here the noun becomes plural, with the meaning of "relics," and remains plural for the remainder of the narrative.</dd>

<div class="chapter">
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Maha-vana (great wood) near the city of Kapilavatthu in the province of the Sakyans together with a great retinue of monks, all of them arahants, and five hundred in number. Devas (gods) from ten thousand world-systems frequently assembled for the purpose of seeing the Blessed One and the bhikkhu-sangha (ordained monks).</p>
<p>Then to four devas of the Suddhavasa (pure Abodes) brahma world, this thought occurred: "The Blessed One is living in the Mahavana near the city of Kapilavatthu in the province of the Sakyans with a great retinue of monks, all of them arahants, and five hundred in number. Devas are frequently assembling there for the purpose of seeing the Blessed One and the bhikkhu-sangha. It is well if we were also to repair to the place where the Blessed One is, and each of us recite a stanza in his presence."</p>
<p>Then those devas as quickly as a strong man might stretch out his arm, or bend his out-stretched arm, vanished from the pure abodes, and appeared before the Blessed One, saluted him, and stood beside him. So standing one of the devas recited this stanza in his presence:</p>
<p><a id="stanza1">1</a>. "There is a great assembly in the forest. A host of devas has assembled. We have come to this dhamma-assembly to see the invincible<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-1' id='fnt-s18-1'>[1]</a> sangha."</p>
<p>Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<p>2. "The monks in this (assembly<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-2' id='fnt-s18-2'>[2]</a>) have collected their thoughts, and made their minds upright. The wise (monks) guard their senses even as a charioteer holds the reins."</p>
<p>Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<p>3. "Having cut off the stake, having dug up the cross-bar (of lust, hate, and delusion), devoid of desire, they go their way, pure, stainless, with vision clear, and well tamed, these young arahants move about like elephants."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-3' id='fnt-s18-3'>[3]</a></p>
<p>Then another deva recited this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<p>4. "They who go for refuge to the Buddha shall not go to evil state of existence; but will quit the human body and fill the ranks of the devas."</p>
<p>The Blessed One then addressed the monks: "Often, monks, devas from the ten world-systems foregather to see the Tathagata (the Buddha) and the monks, the community of bhikkhus. Devas have assembled before the consummate (arahanto), supreme Buddhas of the past; devas will appear before the consummate, supreme Buddhas of the future as they do assemble now before me. I will tell you, monks, the names of the host of devas, I will reveal the names of the host of devas. Listen, pay attention. I will speak." "Yes, Venerable Sir," said the monks by way of assent. The Blessed One said this:<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-4' id='fnt-s18-4'>[4]</a></p>
<p>5-6. "In measured speech<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-5' id='fnt-s18-5'>[5]</a> I will give utterance. The terrestrial devas remain in their realm. Those bent on meditation frequent rocky clefts. Well composed they (arahants) live like solitary lions overcoming the fear that causes hair to stand on end, with immaculate minds, pure, serene, and undefiled."</p>
<p>7. Knowing that there were in the forest, near the city of Kapilavatthu, five hundred and more disciples, delighted in the word of the Buddha, the Master thereupon addressed them:</p>
<p>8. "Monks, hosts of devas have assembled. Do know them well." And they (the monks) hearing the word <i>(sasanam)</i> of the Buddha, strove ardently (to see and know them).</p>
<p>9. There arose in them knowledge of perceiving the non-humans. Some saw one hundred, some thousand non-humans (devas and brahmas), and others seventy thousand non-humans.</p>
<p>10. Some saw one hundred thousand non-humans, others saw countless numbers, every quarter being filled with them.</p>
<p>11. Thereupon the seeing One (the Buddha) knowing all things through super knowledge, addressed the disciples delighted in the word of the Buddha:</p>
<p>12. "Monks, host of devas have assembled. I will announce them to you in words, and in due order. Know ye them.</p>
<p>13. "Seven thousand terrestrial yakkhas<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-6' id='fnt-s18-6'>[6]</a> of Kapilavatthu possessed of iddhi (super normal) power, radiant, comely, and followed by a retinue of attendants,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-7' id='fnt-s18-7'>[7]</a> have come rejoicing to the forest to see<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-8' id='fnt-s18-8'>[8]</a> the assembly of (arahant) monks.</p>
<p>14. "Six thousand Yakkhas from the Himalayan mountain, diverse in hue, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and followed by a retinue of attendants, have come rejoicing to this forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>15. "Three thousand Yakkhas from the Sata's mountain (satagira), diverse in hue, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and followed by a retinue of attendants, have come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>16. "Thus sixteen thousand Yakkhas, diverse in hue, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and followed by a retinue of attendants, have come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>17. "Five hundred Yakkhas from the Vessamitta mountain, diverse in hue, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and followed by a retinue of attendants, have come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>18. "Kumbhira of Rajagala town, having his dwelling on Vepulla's Mountain, with more than a hundred thousand Yakkhas in his train, has come to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>19-20. "Dhatarattha, King of the East, adviser to the Eastern clime, and Chief of the Gandhabbas, followed by a retinue of attendants, and with his many mighty sons (devaputtas), Inda their names, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and with a retinue, has come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>21-22. "Virulha, King of the South, adviser to the Southern clime, and Chief of the Kumbhandas, followed by a retinue of attendants, and with his many mighty sons, Inda their names, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and with a retinue of attendants, has come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>23-24. "Virupakkha, King of the West, adviser to the Western clime, and Chief of the Nagas, followed by a retinue of attendants, and with his many mighty sons, Inda their names, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and with a retinue of attendants, has come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>25-26. "Kuvera, King of the North, adviser to the Northern clime, and Chief of the Yakkhas, followed by a retinue of attendants, and with his many mighty sons, Inda their names, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and with a retinue of attendants, has come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>27-28. "Dhatarattha over the East, to the South Virulhaka, Westward Virupakkha, Kuvera over the North &mdash; these four great Kings stood illuminating the four quarters of the forest in the vicinity of Kapilavatthu.</p>

<p>32. "Along with these (Gandhabba) kings, other Gandhabba kings too, have come rejoicing with each other to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>33. "Then came the (divine) Nagas of the (lake Nabhasa), those of the Naga realm Visali together with the Nagas named Tacchaka. Also came Nagas of Kambala and Assatara and Payaga accompanied by their relatives.</p>
<p>34. "Nagas from Yamuna, and those of the race of Dhatarattha came with their retinue of attendants, and Eravana, the great Naga too, came to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>

<p>36. "At that time the Naga king (with other Nagas) were free from fear. The Buddha vouchsafed his protection to the Nagas from the harpies (suppana). Entreating one another with gentle words, the Nagas and Suppanas (harpies) took refuge in the Buddha.</p>
<p>37. "The Asuras dwelling in the ocean were defeated by Vajirahattha (Sakka). They are brethren of Vasavassa (Sakka)<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-10' id='fnt-s18-10'>[10]</a> possessed of iddhi power, and are followed by a retinue of attendants.</p>

<p>39. "Hundreds of the sons of Bali, all of them named after Veroca (that is their uncle Rahu), with an armed host of warriors, approached Rahu (Asurendra, the lord of Asuras), and said: 'Lord, it is time to go to the forest to see the assembly of monks.'</p>

<p>52. "All those ten groups of Devas of diverse hue, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and with a retinue of attendants, have come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>53. "There also came the Devas Sukha, Karumha, Aruna with Veghanasa. The Deva Odatagayha, Pamokkha, and Vicakkhana alos came.</p>
<p>54. "Sadamatta, Haragaja, mighty Missaka and Pajjuna, who causes rain to pour in every direction, came thundering.</p>

<p>56. "The Devas Khemiya, Tusita, Yama, the mighty Katthaka, Lambhitaka, Lamasettha, Joti, and Asava also came.</p>
<p>57-58. "There also came the Devas Nimmanarati, and Paranimmita (Vasavatthi). All these ten groups of Devas of diverse hue, possessed of iddhi power, radiant, comely, and with a retinue of attendants, have come rejoicing to the forest to see the assembly of monks.</p>
<p>59. "These sixty (six of ten groups, indicated in the order of Apo Deva, etc.) Devas of diverse hue, according to their name and class, have come with others (similar in name and class).</p>
<p><a id="stanza60">60</a>. (These Devas came saying:) "'Let us see (the Sangha, the arahant monks), who have outlived birth, who have removed the stake (of lust, hate, and delusion), who have crossed the four currents or streams (of sense-pleasures, becoming, wrong views and ignorance),<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-13' id='fnt-s18-13'>[13]</a> free from taints. (Let us also see the Buddha) who has crossed the streams, who is called Naga (in the sense of one who commits no evil)<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-14' id='fnt-s18-14'>[14]</a> and shining like the unclouded moon.'</p>
<p>61. "The Brahmas Subrahma and Paramatta, came (with other Brahmas) who are possessed of iddhi power, and sons (disciples of the Buddha). The Brahmas Sanankumara and Tissa also came to the forest (to see the assembly of monks).</p>
<p>62-63. "There is born a Mahabrahma (for every Brahma world) excelling other Brahmas, mighty in power, with a formidable stature, and of great glory. Among them, ten chief Brahmas, lords over their retinues have come, and in the midst of them with all his attendants came Brahma Harita.</p>
<p>64. "When all the Devas headed by Inda (Sakka), and all Brahmas headed by Haritta had come, there came the host of Mara. Lo! The folly of Mara, the Murky One, (Kanha).<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s18-15' id='fnt-s18-15'>[15]</a></p>
<p>65. "'Come on, seize them, bind them, let them all be bound by lust, surrounded on every side, suffer not anybody to escape' (Thus Vasavatti Mara gave order).</p>
<p>66-67. "Mara thus striking the earth with his palm and thereby producing a dreadful sound as when a storm cloud thunders and causes lightning during rainy season, sent his black army to the midst of the Devas. Nevertheless, unable to bring the Devas under his sway, he filled with anger. He recoiled.</p>
<p>68. "Then the Seeing One (the Buddha) knowing perfectly well what had transpired, addressed his disciples who take delight in the word of the Buddha.</p>
<p>69. "'Monks, the host of Mara have come (and gone). Know them (beware of them).' And they (non-arahants) hearing the word of the Buddha, strove (to gain Deliverance) from their defilements. (From the passion-free arahants) the army of Mara has departed; even so much as a hair in them (arahants) was not affected.</p>
<p>70. "All those disciples (monks) are victors in the war of passions; they are free from fear, glorious, and renowned among mankind. They live rejoicing with Aryan disciples." (Praising thus Mara departed.)</p>

<h1>Translator's Introduction</h1>
<p>This discourse is an interesting example of the folklore of the Pali canon. It shows that the tendency of Asian popular Buddhism to regard the Buddha as a protective figure, and not just as a teacher, has its roots in the earliest part of the tradition. Metrical analysis indicates that the long "tribute" section of this discourse is very old, while the verses in the introductory section &mdash; which is also found in the Samyutta Nikaya &mdash; are later in form. This fits with a more subjective judgment: that the tribute was an earlier composition &mdash; in the honorific style of the ancient court bards &mdash; to which the introduction was added later. This judgment is based on the fact that the two sections do not quite fit each other. The introduction to the tribute indicates that the reciter of the tribute is the Buddha himself, whereas the narration in the tribute indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>At any rate, this discourse is the closest thing in the Pali canon to a "who's who" of the deva worlds, and should provide useful material for anyone interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism.</p>
<p>The Commentary reports the belief that the devas enjoy hearing this discourse chanted in Pali. Until recently it was part of many monks' standard memorized repertoire, to be chanted at weddings and the dedication of new buildings. Even today, as many of the traditions of memorization in Asia seem to be falling by the wayside, there are a few monks and laypeople who chant this discourse regularly.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the <a id="sakyan">Sakyans</a> at <a id="kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a> in the Great Wood, together with a large Sangha of approximately five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants. And most of the devatas from ten world-systems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu Sangha. Then the thought occurred to four devatas of the ranks from the Pure Abodes: "The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood, together with a large Sangha of about five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants. And most of the devatas from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu Sangha. Let us also approach the Blessed One and, on arrival, let us each speak a verse in his presence."</p>
<p>Then, <a id="strongman">just as</a> a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, those devatas disappeared from among the devas of the Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed One. Having paid homage to the Blessed One, they stood to one side. As they were standing there, one devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
A great meeting in the woods:
The deva hosts have assembled.
We have come to this Dhamma meeting
To see the invincible Sangha.
</div>

<p>Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
The bhikkhus there are concentrated,
Have straightened their own minds.
Like a charioteer holding the reins,
The wise ones guard their faculties.
</div>

<p>Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Having cut through barrenness, cut the cross-bar,
Having uprooted <a id="indra">Indra</a>'s pillar, unstirred,
They wander about pure, unstained,
Young nagas well tamed by the One with Vision.
</div>

<p>Then another devata recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
Those who have gone to the Buddha for refuge
Will not go to the plane of woe.
On discarding the human body,
They will fill the hosts of the devas.
</div>

<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, most of the devatas from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Tathagata and the Bhikkhu Sangha. Those who, in the past, were Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, at most had their devata-gathering like mine at the present. Those who, in the future, will be Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, will at most have their devata-gathering like mine at the present. I will detail for you the names of the deva hosts. I will describe to you the names of the deva hosts. I will teach you the names of the deva hosts. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
<p>"As you say, lord," the monks replied. The Blessed One said:</p>

<div class='freeverse'>
I recite a verse of tribute.
Those who live where spirits dwell,
who live in mountain caves,
resolute, concentrated,
many, like hidden lions,
who have overcome horripilation,
white-hearted, pure,
serene, and undisturbed:
Knowing that more than 500 of them
had come to the forest of Kapilavatthu,
the Teacher then said to them,
disciples delighting in his instruction,
"The deva hosts have approached.
Detect them, monks!"
Listening to the Awakened One's instruction,
they made an ardent effort.
Knowledge appeared to them,
vision of non-human beings.
Some saw 100, some 1,000, some 70,000,
some had vision of 100,000 non-human beings.
Some gained vision of innumerable devas
filling every direction.
Realizing all this,
the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.
The Teacher then said to them,
disciples delighting in his instruction,
"The deva hosts have approached.
Detect them, monks,
as I describe their glories, one by one.

Dhatarattha from the Eastern Direction,
Virulhaka from the South,
Virupakkha from the West,
Kuvera from the Northern Direction:
These four Great Kings
encompassing the four directions,
resplendent, stand in the Kapilavatthu forest.

Their deceitful vassals have also come
 &mdash;  deceptive, treacherous  &mdash;
<a id="maya">Maya</a>, <a id="kutendu">Kutendu</a>, <a id="vetendu">vetendu</a>,

comes the prestigious naga, <a id="dhatarattha-naga">Dhatarattha</a>.
The great naga <a id="eravanna">Eravanna</a>:
He, too, has come
to the forest meeting."

They who swoop down swiftly on naga kings,
divine, twice-born, winged, their eyesight pure:
(Garudas) came from the sky to the midst of the forest.
<a id="citra">Citra</a> and <a id="supanna">Supanna</a> are their names.
But the Buddha made the naga kings safe,
made them secure from Supanna.
Addressing one another with affectionate words,
the nagas and Supannas made the Buddha their refuge.

"Defeated by Indra of the thunderbolt hand,
<a id="asura">Asuras</a> dwelling in the ocean,

rejoicing, have approached

<a id="vendu">Vendu</a> (Visnu) and <a id="sahali">Sahali</a>,

glamorous, prestigious,
rejoicing, have approached

blazing like crests of fire-flame.
The <a id="arittaka">Arittakas</a>, <a id="roja">Rojas</a>,
cornflower blue.
<a id="varuna">Varunas</a> and <a id="sahadhamma">Sahadhammas</a>,
<a id="accuta">Accutas</a> and <a id="anejaka">Anejakas</a>,
<a id="suleyya">Suleyyas</a> and <a id="rucira">Ruciras</a>,
and <a id="vasavanesi">Vasavanesis</a> have come.
These ten ten-fold hosts, all of varied hue,
powerful, effulgent,
glamorous, prestigious,
rejoicing, have approached
the monks' forest meeting.

<a id="samana">Samanas</a> and Great Samanas,
<a id="manusa">Manusas</a> and Super Manusas,

as well as devas corrupted by mind.
Then come green-gold devas and those wearing red.
<a id="paraga">Paragas</a> and Great Paragas,
prestigious devas have come.
These ten ten-fold hosts, all of varied hue,
powerful, effulgent,
glamorous, prestigious,
rejoicing, have approached
the monks' forest meeting.

White devas, ruddy-green devas, dawn-devas
have come with the <a id="veghana">Veghanas</a>
headed by devas totally in white.
The <a id="vicakkhana">Vicakkhanas</a> have come.
<a id="sadamatta">Sadamatta</a>, <a id="haragajas">Haragajas</a>,
and the prestigious multi-coloreds,
<a id="pajunna">Pajunna</a>, the thunderer,
who brings rain in all directions:
These ten ten-fold hosts, all of varied hue,
powerful, effulgent,
glamorous, prestigious,
rejoicing, have approached
the monks' forest meeting.

The <a id="khemiya">Khemiyas</a>, <a id="tusita">Tusitas</a>, and <a id="yamas">Yamas</a>,
the prestigious <a id="katthaka">Katthakas</a>,
<a id="lambitaka">Lambitakas</a>, and <a id="lama">Lama</a> chiefs,
the <a id="jotinama">Jotinamas</a> and <a id="asava">Asavas</a>,
the <a id="nimmanarati">Nimmanaratis</a> have come,
as have the <a id="paranimmita">Paranimmitas</a>.
These ten ten-fold hosts, all of varied hue,
powerful, effulgent,
glamorous, prestigious,
rejoicing, have approached
the monks' forest meeting.

These 60 deva groups, all of varied hue,
have come arranged in order,
together with others in like manner [thinking:]
'We'll see the one who has transcended birth,
who has no bounds, who has crossed over the flood,
fermentation-free,
the Mighty One, crossing over the flood
like the moon emerging from the dark fortnight.'

<a id="subrahma">Subrahma</a> and <a id="paramatta">Paramatta</a> Brahma,
together with sons of the Powerful One,
<a id="sanankumara">Sanankumara</a> and <a id="tissa">Tissa</a>:
They too have come to the forest meeting.
Great Brahma, who stands over
1,000 Brahma worlds,
who arose there spontaneously, effulgent:
Prestigious is he, with a terrifying body.
And ten brahma sovereigns,
each the lord of his own realm  &mdash;
and in their midst has come
Harita Brahma surrounded by his retinue."

When all these devas with Indras &amp; Brahmas had come,
	<a id="mara">Mara's army</a> came as well.
Now look at the Dark One's foolishness!
[He said:] "Come seize them! Bind them!
Tie them down with passion!
Surround them on every side!
Don't let anyone at all escape!"
Thus the great war-lord urged on his dark army,
slapping the ground with his hand,
making a horrendous din, as when
a storm cloud bursts with thunder,
lightning, and torrents of rain.
But then he withdrew-enraged,
with none under his sway.
Realizing all this,
the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.
The Teacher then said to them,
disciples delighting in his instruction,
"Mara's army has approached.
Detect them, monks!"
Listening to the Awakened One's instruction,
they made an ardent effort.
The army retreated
from those without passion,
without raising even a hair on their bodies.
Having all won the battle
 &mdash;  prestigious, past fear  &mdash;
they rejoice with all beings:
Disciples outstanding among the human race.

<p>Having been given leave by the Blessed One, Sakka the deva-king asked him his first question: "Fettered with what, dear sir &mdash; though they think, 'May we live free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile' &mdash; do devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, &amp; whatever other many kinds of beings there are, nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those who are hostile?"</p>
<p>Thus Sakka asked his first question of the Blessed One, and the Blessed One, when asked, replied: "Devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, &amp; whatever other many kinds of beings there are, are fettered with envy &amp; stinginess, which is why &mdash; even though they think, 'May we live free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from those who are hostile' &mdash; they nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those who are hostile."</p>
<p>Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka the deva-king. Gratified, Sakka was delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words: "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome."</p>
<p>Then Sakka, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: "But what, dear sir, is the cause of envy &amp; stinginess, what is their origination, what gives them birth, what is their source? When what exists do they come into being? When what doesn't exist do they not?"</p>
<p>"Envy &amp; stinginess have dear-&amp;-not-dear as their cause, have dear-&amp;-not-dear as their origination, have dear-&amp;-not-dear as what gives them birth, have dear-&amp;-not-dear as their source. When dear-&amp;-not-dear exist, they come into being. When dear-&amp;-not-dear are not, they don't."</p>
<p>"But what, dear sir, is the cause of dear-&amp;-not-dear, what is their origination, what gives them birth, what is their source? When what exists do they come into being? When what doesn't exist do they not?"</p>
<p>"Dear-&amp;-not-dear have desire as their cause, have desire as their origination, have desire as what gives them birth, have desire as their source. When desire exists, they come into being. When desire is not, they don't."</p>
<p>"But what, dear sir, is the cause of desire, what is its origination, what gives it birth, what is its source? When what exists does it come into being? When what doesn't exist does it not?"</p>
<p>"Desire has thinking as its cause, has thinking as its origination, has thinking as what gives it birth, has thinking as its source. When thinking exists, desire comes into being. When thinking is not, it doesn't."</p>
<p>"But what, dear sir, is the cause of thinking, what is its origination, what gives it birth, what is its source? When what exists does it come into being? When what doesn't exist does it not?"</p>
<p>"<a id="papanca">Thinking</a> has the perceptions &amp; categories of objectification<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> as its cause, has the perceptions &amp; categories of objectification as its origination, has the perceptions &amp; categories of objectification as what gives it birth, has the perceptions &amp; categories of objectification as its source. When the perceptions &amp; categories of objectification exist, thinking comes into being. When the perceptions &amp; categories of objectification are not, it doesn't."</p>
<p>"And how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions &amp; categories of objectification?"</p>
<p>"<a id="joy">Joy</a> is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> Grief is of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued. Equanimity is of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.</p>
<p>"'Joy is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When one knows of a feeling of joy, 'As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of joy is not to be pursued. When one knows of a feeling of joy, 'As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of joy is to be pursued. And this sort of joy may be accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation or free of directed thought &amp; evaluation. Of the two, the latter is the more refined. 'Joy is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>
<p>"'<a id="grief">Grief</a> is of two sorts, I tell you: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When one knows of a feeling of grief, 'As I pursue this grief, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of grief is not to be pursued. When one knows of a feeling of grief, 'As I pursue this grief, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of grief is to be pursued. And this sort of grief may be accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation or free of directed thought &amp; evaluation. Of the two, the latter is the more refined. 'Grief is of two sorts, I tell you: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>
<p>"'<a id="equanimity">Equanimity</a> is of two sorts, I tell you: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When one knows of a feeling of equanimity, 'As I pursue this equanimity, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of equanimity is not to be pursued. When one knows of a feeling of equanimity, 'As I pursue this equanimity, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of equanimity is to be pursued. And this sort of equanimity may be accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation or free of directed thought &amp; evaluation. Of the two, the latter is the more refined. 'Equanimity is of two sorts, I tell you: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>
<p>"This is how he has practiced, deva-king: the monk who has practiced the practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions &amp; categories of objectification."</p>
<p>Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka the deva-king. Gratified, Sakka was delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words: "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome."</p>
<p>Then Sakka, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: "But how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has practiced for restraint in the Patimokkha?"</p>
<p>"<a id="bodily">Bodily conduct</a> is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued. Verbal conduct is of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued. Searching is of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.</p>
<p>"'Bodily conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When one knows of bodily conduct, 'As I pursue this bodily conduct, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of bodily conduct is not to be pursued. When one knows of bodily conduct, 'As I pursue this bodily conduct, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of bodily conduct is to be pursued. 'Bodily conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>
<p>"'<a id="verbal">Verbal conduct</a> is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said?

'Verbal conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>
<p>"'<a id="searching">Searching</a> is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When one knows of a search, 'As I pursue this search, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of search is not to be pursued. When one knows of a search, 'As I pursue this search, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of search is to be pursued. 'Searching is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.</p>
<p>"This is how he has practiced, deva-king: the monk who has practiced the practice for restraint in the Patimokkha."</p>
<p>Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka the deva-king. Gratified, Sakka was delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words: "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome."</p>
<p>Then Sakka, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: "But how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has practiced for restraint with regard to the sense faculties?"</p>
<p>"<a id="forms">Forms</a> cognizable by the eye are of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued. Sounds cognizable by the ear... Aromas cognizable by the nose... Flavors cognizable by the tongue... Tactile sensations cognizable by the body... Ideas cognizable by the intellect are of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued."</p>
<p>When this was said, Sakka the deva-king said to the Blessed One, "Dear sir, I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement. If, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of form cognizable by the eye is not to be pursued. But if, as one pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of form cognizable by the eye is to be pursued.</p>
<p>"If, as one pursues a certain type of sound cognizable by the ear...</p>
<p>"If, as one pursues a certain type of aroma cognizable by the nose...</p>
<p>"If, as one pursues a certain type of flavor cognizable by the tongue...</p>
<p>"If, as one pursues a certain type of tactile sensation cognizable by the body...</p>
<p>"If, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is not to be pursued. But if, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is to be pursued.</p>
<p>"This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome."</p>
<p><a id="goal">Then Sakka</a>, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: "Dear sir, do all brahmans &amp; contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal?"</p>
<p>"No, deva-king, not all brahmans &amp; contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal."</p>
<p>"Why, dear sir, don't all brahmans &amp; contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal?"</p>
<p>"The world is made up of many properties, various properties. Because of the many &amp; various properties in the world, then whichever property living beings get fixated on, they become entrenched &amp; latch onto it, saying, 'Only this is true; anything else is worthless.' This is why not all brahmans &amp; contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal."</p>
<p>"But, dear sir, are all brahmans &amp; contemplatives utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate?"</p>
<p>"No, deva-king, not all brahmans &amp; contemplatives are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate."</p>
<p>"But why, dear sir, are not all brahmans &amp; contemplatives utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate?"</p>
<p>"Those monks who are released through the total ending of craving are the ones who are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate. This is why not all brahmans &amp; contemplatives are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate."</p>
<p>Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka the deva-king. Gratified, Sakka was delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words: "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is overcome."</p>
<p>Then Sakka, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed One's words, said to him: "Yearning is a disease, yearning is a boil, yearning is an arrow. It seduces one, drawing one into this or that state of being, which is why one is reborn in high states &amp; low. Whereas other outside brahmans &amp; contemplatives gave me no chance to ask them these questions, the Blessed One has answered at length, so that he has removed the arrow of my uncertainty &amp; perplexity."</p>
<p>"Deva-king, do you recall having asked other brahmans &amp; contemplatives these questions?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord, I recall having asked other brahmans &amp; contemplatives these questions."</p>
<p>"If it's no inconvenience, could you tell me how they answered?"</p>
<p>"It's no inconvenience when sitting with the Blessed One or one who is like him."</p>
<p>"Then tell me, deva-king."</p>
<p>"Having gone to those whom I considered to be brahmans &amp; contemplatives living in isolated dwellings in the wilderness, I asked them these questions. But when asked by me, they were at a loss. Being at a loss, they asked <i>me</i> in return, 'What is your name?'</p>
<p>"Being asked, I responded, 'I, dear sir, am Sakka, the deva-king.'</p>
<p>"So they questioned me further, 'But what kamma did you do to attain to this state?'</p>
<p>"So I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard &amp; mastered it. And they were gratified with just this much: 'We have seen Sakka, the deva-king, and he has answered our questions!' So, instead of my becoming their disciple, they simply became mine. But I, lord, am the Blessed One's disciple, a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening."</p>
<p>"Deva-king, do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness &amp; joy?"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord, I do."</p>
<p>"And how do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness &amp; joy?"</p>
<p>"Once, lord, the devas &amp; asuras were arrayed in battle. And in that battle the devas won, while the asuras lost. Having won the battle, as the victor in the battle, this thought occurred to me: 'Whatever has been the divine nourishment of the asuras, whatever has been the divine nourishment of the devas, the devas will now enjoy both of them.' But my attainment of happiness &amp; joy was in the sphere of violence &amp; weapons. It didn't lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding. But my attainment of happiness &amp; joy on hearing the Blessed One's Dhamma is in the sphere of no violence, the sphere of no weapons. It leads to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><a id="stream">Then Sakka</a>, the deva-king, touched the earth with his hand and said three times, "Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One! Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One! Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly Self-awakened One!"</p>
<p><a id="eye"></a>While this explanation was being given, there arose to Sakka the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye &mdash; "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation" &mdash; as it also did to [his following of] 80,000 other devas.</p>
<p>Such were the questions that the Blessed One answered at Sakka's bidding. And so this discourse is called "Sakka's Questions."</p>

	<dd>Objectification = <i>papa&ntilde;ca.</i> The tendency of the mind to proliferate issues from the sense of "self." This term can also be translated as self-reflexive thinking, reification, falsification, distortion, elaboration, or exaggeration. In the discourses, it is frequently used in analyses of the psychology of conflict. The categories of objectification stem from the self-reflexive thought, "I am the thinker," (see <a href="../kn/snp/snp.4.14.than.html">Sn 4.14</a>), and include the categories of inappropriate attention (see <a href="../mn/mn.002.than.html">MN 2</a>): being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to. The perceptions of objectification include such thoughts as "This is me. This is mine. This is my self." These perceptions and categories turn back on the person who allows them to proliferate, giving rise to internal conflict &amp; strife, which then expand outward. For more on these terms, see <a href="../mn/mn.018.than.html">MN 18</a>.</dd>

[SUMMARY]={This sutta offers comprehensive practical instructions on the development of mindfulness in meditation. The Buddha describes how the development of continuous mindfulness of the four <i>satipatthana</i> ("foundations of mindfulness" or "frames of reference") &mdash; mindfulness of the body, of feelings, of the mind, and of mind-objects &mdash; can lead ultimately to full Awakening. [The text of this sutta is identical to that of the <a href='../mn/mn.010.than.html'>Satipatthana Sutta</a> (MN 10), except that the Majjhima version omits the exposition of the Four Noble Truths (sections 5a,b,c and d in part D of this version).]}

<h2>Perception of the True Nature of the Body</h2>

<h3>1. Section on Breathing</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-374'>374.</a></span>
Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the body?</p>

<p>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following the practice of my Teaching, having gone to the forest, or to the foot of a tree or to an empty, solitary place, sits down cross-legged, keeping his body erect, and sets up mindfulness, orienting it.<!-- fn16 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-16' id='fnt-16' title='Towards the object of .'>[16]</a> 
</p>

<p>Then with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes out.</p>

<p>Breathing in a long inhalation, he is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation, or breathing out a long exhalation, he is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation.</p>

<p>Breathing in a short inhalation, he is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation, or breathing out a short exhalation, he is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation.</p>

<p>He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in-coming breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out-going breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. [By being fully conscious of the inhalation] he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in. [By being fully conscious of the exhalation] he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out. <!-- fn17 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-17' id='fnt-17' title='No special effort is necessary to calm down the strong inhalation and exhalation. The more one gets mental concentration the more the strong inhalation and exhalation will calm down. When the mental concentration reaches its highest point, inhalation and ...'>[17]</a></p>

<p>Just as, bhikkhus, a skilful turner or a turner's apprentice knows a long pull<!-- fn18 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-18' id='fnt-18' title='On the string turning the .'>[18]</a> when a long pull is made, or knows a short pull when a short pull is made, even so, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu breathing in a long inhalation is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation, or breathing out a long exhalation is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation, or breathing in a short inhalation is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation, or breathing out a short exhalation is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in-coming breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out-going breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in. He trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out.</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his.<!-- fn19 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-19' id='fnt-19' title='I.e., it is his own breathing, and he perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature.'>[19]</a></p>

<p>Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena<!-- fn20 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-20' id='fnt-20' title='Which is the .'>[20]</a> of others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his<!-- fn21 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-21' id='fnt-21' title='His own .'>[21]</a> or which is that of others.</p>

<p>When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena with their causes. <!-- fn22 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-22' id='fnt-22' title='The causes of the appearing and dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is inhalation and exhalation are the existence or the non-existence of the body, the nose and the mind.'>[22]</a></p>

<p>And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena.<!-- fn23 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-23' id='fnt-23' title='Which is inhaling and .'>[23]</a> That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights<!-- fn24 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-24' id='fnt-24' title='I.e.,'>[24]</a> progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Breathing]</p>


<h3>2. Section on Body Movement and Posture</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-375'>375.</a></span>
And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu when walking, is conscious of walking; or when standing, he is conscious of standing; or when sitting, he is conscious of sitting; or when lying down, he is conscious of lying down; or in whatever movement or posture his body is, he is conscious of it.</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body.<!-- fn25 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-25' id='fnt-25' title='And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless, and repulsive nature.'>[25]</a> Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others. In this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his own body or which is that of others.</p>

<p>When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body, with their causes.<!-- fn26 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-26' id='fnt-26' title='The causes of appearing of physical phenomena are ignorance of the Four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment. They and their effect, i.e., the continuous appearance of physical phenomena, are called five Samudaya dhamma. The perception of these ...'>[26]</a></p>

<p>And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena.<!-- fn27 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-27' id='fnt-27' title='"Without soul or atta directing it" -- this shows the mental state of the bhikkhu when his mindfulness is at its height. Before he reaches this mental state, he occasionally imagines, in spite of his efforts to be mindful, (a) that body and limbs are his,...'>[27]</a></p>

<p>That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights<!-- fn28 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-28' id='fnt-28' title='I.e.,'>[28]</a> progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Body Movement and Posture]</p>


<h3>3. Section on Clear Comprehension</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-376'>376.</a></span>
And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu in moving forward and in moving back does so with clear comprehension; in looking straight ahead and sideways, he does so with clear comprehension; in bending and in stretching his limbs, he does so with clear comprehension; in carrying or wearing the great robe, alms-bowl and the other two robes, he does so with clear comprehension; in eating, drinking, chewing and savouring, he does so with clear comprehension; in defecating and urinating, he does so with clear comprehension; in walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking, speaking or in keeping silent, he does so with clear comprehension.</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Clear Comprehension]</p>

<h3>4. Section on Consideration of Repulsiveness</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-377'>377.</a></span>
And again. bhikkhus, the bhikkhu examines and reflects closely upon this very body, from the soles of the feet up and from the tips of the hair down, enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities, [thinking thus:] &quot;There are in this body: hair of the head, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes,<!-- fn29 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-29' id='fnt-29' title='Including the pleura, the diaphragm and other forms of membrane in the .'>[29]</a> spleen, lungs, large intestine, small intestine, contents of the stomach, faeces, (brain),<!-- fn30 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-30' id='fnt-30' title='The brain is not included in the Pali Text of this Sutta; but is included in the Patisambhida Magga.'>[30]</a> bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, solid fat, tears, liquid fat, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid<!-- fn31 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-31' id='fnt-31' title='I.e., lubricating oil of the .'>[31]</a> and urine.</p>

<p>Just as if, bhikkhus, there were a bag with an opening at each end, and full of various kinds of grain such as hill-paddy, paddy, green gram, cow-pea, sesame and husked rice; and a man with sound eyes, having opened it, should examine and reflect on the contents thus: &quot;This is hill-paddy, this is paddy, this is green gram, this is cow-pea, this is sesame, this is husked rice,&quot; even so, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body, from the soles of the feet up and from the tips of the hair down, enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities, [thinking thus:] &quot;There are in this body: hair of the head,... urine.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Consideration of Repulsiveness]</p>


<h3>5. Section on Consideration of the Primary Elements</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-378'>378.</a></span>
And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this body, in whatever position it remains or is placed, as composed of the primary elements:<!-- fn32 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-32' id='fnt-32' title='The primary elements: dhatu, &#039;element&#039;, is a force of Nature which behaves in accordance with the laws of Nature. The four primary elements literally translated above for the sake of brevity as &#039;earth, water, fire, and air elements&#039; ...'>[32]</a> &quot;There are in this body only the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.&quot;</p>

<p>Just as if, bhikkhus, a skilful butcher or a butcher's apprentice, having slaughtered a cow and cut it up into portions should be sitting at the junction of four main roads,<!-- fn33 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-33' id='fnt-33' title='So that only pieces of meat are seen and not the cow as .'>[33]</a> even so the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body in whatever position it remains or is placed, as composed of the primary elements:</p>

<p>&quot;There are in this body only the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>[End of the Section on Consideration of the Primary Elements]</p>



<h3>6. Section on Nine Kinds of Corpses</h3>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-379'>379.</a></span>
And again, bhikkhus, as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body, one day dead, or two days dead, or three days dead, swollen, turning black and blue, and festering, abandoned in the charnel-ground, he applies this perception to his own body thus: &quot;Indeed, this body of mine, too, is of the same nature; it will become like that; it cannot escape such a fate.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>And again, bhikkhus, as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body abandoned in the charnel-ground, being devoured by crows, being devoured by hawks, being devoured by vultures, being devoured by herons, being devoured by dogs, being devoured by tigers, being devoured by leopards, being devoured by jackals, or being devoured by various kinds of worms, he applies this perception to his own body thus: &quot;Indeed, this body of mine, too, is of the same nature; it will become like that: it cannot escape such a fate.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>And again, bhikkhus, as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body abandoned in the charnel-ground &mdash; reduced to a skeleton held together by the tendons, with some flesh and blood still adhering to it... reduced to a skeleton held together by the tendons, blood-besmeared, fleshless... reduced to a skeleton still held together by the tendons, without flesh and blood... reduced to loose bones scattered in all directions &mdash; at one place bones of a hand, at another place bones of a foot, at another place ankle-bones, at another place shin-bones, at another place thigh-bones, at another place hip-bones, at another place rib-bones, at another place spinal-bones, at another place shoulder-bones, at another place neck-bones, at another place the jawbone, at another place the teeth, at another place the skull he a applies this perception to his own body thus: &quot;Indeed, this body of mine. too, is of the same nature; it will become like that; it cannot escape such a fate.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.</p>

<p>And again, bhikkhus, as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body abandoned in the charnel-ground &mdash; reduced to bleached bones of conch-like color... reduced to bones more than a year old, lying in a heap... reduced to rotted bones, crumbling to dust, he then applies this perception to his own body thus: &quot;Indeed, this body of mine, too, is of the same nature; it will become like that; it cannot escape such a fate.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his.<!-- fn34 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-34' id='fnt-34' title='I.e., it is his own breathing, and he perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature.'>[34]</a></p>

Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of others.

<p>When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena.

<p>[End of the Fourteen Ways<!-- fn43 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-43' id='fnt-43' title='Fourteen Ways: consisting of one way of perception in each of the first five sections and nine ways of perception in the sixth and last Section.'>[43]</a> of Perception of the True Nature of the Body.]</p>

<h2>Perception of the True Nature of the Sensation</h2>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-380'>380.</a></span>
Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on sensation, vedan&#257;?<!-- fn44 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-44' id='fnt-44' title='And perceive its impermanent, insecure, and soulless .'>[44]</a></p>

<p>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu who follows my Teaching, when experiencing a pleasant sensation, knows that a pleasant sensation is experienced; or when experiencing an unpleasant sensation, knows that an unpleasant sensation is experienced; or when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant, knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant is experienced.</p>

<p>When experiencing a pleasant sensation associated with sensual desires, he knows that a pleasant sensation associated with sensual desires is experienced; or when experiencing a pleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires, he knows that a pleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires is experienced; when experiencing an unpleasant sensation associated with sensual desires, he knows that an unpleasant sensation associated with sensual desires is experienced; or when experiencing an unpleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires, he knows that an unpleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires is experienced; when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant associated with sensual desires, he knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant associated with sensual desires is experienced; or when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant not associated with sensual desires, he knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant not associated with sensual desires is experienced.</p>

<p>Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation, vedan&#257; experienced by himself.<!-- fn45 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-45' id='fnt-45' title='And perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless .'>[45]</a> Occasionally he realizes that sensation experienced by others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on sensation experienced by others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on sensation experienced by himself or by others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of sensation. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of sensation.

<p>Having got rid of vitakka and vicara, the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana, with internal tranquillity, with enhancement of one-pointedness of Concentration, devoid of vitakka and vicara, but with piti and sukha born of Concentration.</p>

<p>Having been detached from piti, that bhikkhu dwells in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and experiences sukha in mind and body. He achieves and remains in the third jhana, that which causes a person who attains it to be praised by the Noble Ones as one who has equanimity and mindfulness, one who abides in sukhas.</p>

<p>By dispelling both pain and pleasure, and by the previous disappearance of sadness and gladness, that bhikkhu achieves and remains in the fourth Jhana, a state of equanimity and absolute purity of mindfulness, without pain or pleasure.</p>

<p>This, bhikkhus, is called Right Concentration.</p>

He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma, with their causes. And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the Four Noble Truths, perceiving their true nature.</p>

Indeed, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for seven years, one of two results is to be certainly expected in him: arahatship<!-- fn125 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-125' id='fnt-125' title='A&ntilde;&ntilde;a, the knowledge of final emancipation, arahatta .'>[125]</a> in this very existence, or if there yet be any trace of Clinging left, the state of an an&#257;g&#257;mi.<!-- fn126 --><a class='noteTag' href='#fn-126' id='fnt-126' title='The state of Non-return to the world of sense-existence, anagami .'>[126]</a></p>

<p>Let alone seven years, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for six years... for five years... for four years... for three years... for two years... for one year</p>

<p>Let alone one year, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for seven months, one of two results is to be certainly expected in him: arahatship in this very existence, or if there yet be any trace of Clinging left, the state of an an&#257;g&#257;mi.</p>

<p>Let alone seven months, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for six months... for five months... for four months... for three months... for two months... for one month... for half-a-month...</p>

<p>Let alone half-a-month, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness in this manner for seven days, one of two results is to be certainly expected in him: arahatship in this very existence, or if there yet be any trace of Clinging left, the state of an an&#257;g&#257;mi.</p>

<p><span class='sutta_ref'><a id='parag-405'>405.</a></span>
Because of these beneficial results, I have declared at the beginning thus: &quot;Bhikkhus, this is the one and only way for the purification of the minds of beings, for overcoming sorrow and lamentation, for the complete destruction of physical pain and mental distress, for attainment of the noble Ariya Magga, and for the realization of Nibb&#257;na. That only way is the practice of the four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness.&quot;</p>

<p>Thus spoke the Bhagava. Delighted, the bhikkhus received the words of the Buddha with respectful appreciation.</p>

<dt><a href='#fnt-26' id='fn-26'>26</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The causes of appearing of physical phenomena are ignorance of the Four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment. They and their effect, i.e., the continuous appearance of physical phenomena, are called five Samudaya dhamm&#257;. The perception of these five Samudaya dhamm&#257; is called Samudaya dhamm&#257;nupassi. They are perceived in the following way:

<p>When the bhikkhu can steadfastly keep his mind on the body-postures by means of diligence, mindfulness, concentration, comprehension, he perceives the sign or incessant appearance of physical phenomena (nibbatti lakkha&#7751;&#257;): This perception usually begins, when the bhikkhu achieves the second vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; paccaya pariggaha &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a. From this perception, the bhikkhu draws the conclusion that rebirth of beings take place in a similar way.</p>

<p>Therefore, while the bhikkhu is perceiving the continuous appearance of physical phenomena he realizes that endless rebirths are due to: (1) ignorance of Four Ariya Truths; (2) craving for pleasure of the senses; (3) kamma (deeds, words and thoughts) which has the potency for rebirth as its effect; (4) nutriment which is essential for physical phenomena; (5) mind (citta) which is the motivating force; (6) heat and cold. The causes of dissolution of physical phenomena are the absence of the above factors.</p>

<p>The bhikkhu then realizes that extinction of ignorance of Four Ariya Truths will cause the extinction of endless appearance of physical phenomena. The actual perception of the sign of change or disappearance or deterioration of physical phenomena will begin when the bhikkhu achieves the third vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; Sammasana &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a. The sign of change is called viparinama lakkha&#7751;&#257;. In fact, the perception of the appearance and disappearance of physical phenomena, by means of nibbatti and viparin&#257;ma lakkha&#7751;&#257;, becomes clearer when the bhikkhu achieves the fourth vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; Udayabbaya &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a. However, the perception of only the disappearance of physical phenomena becomes stronger, when he achieves the fifth vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; bha&#7749;ga &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a.</p></dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-27' id='fn-27'>27</a>.</dt>
		<dd>"Without soul or atta directing it" &mdash; this shows the mental state of the bhikkhu when his mindfulness is at its height. Before he reaches this mental state, he occasionally imagines, in spite of his efforts to be mindful, (a) that body and limbs are his, (b) that his j&#299;va (soul or atta) is directing them, to make postures. Occasionally, he even feels proud of and pleased with &quot;his&quot; body and limbs."

<p>These false views of the body and limbs begin to disappear when he achieves the fifth vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a &mdash; bha&#7749;ga &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a. From that stage the bhikkhu perceives only the deterioration of the body. And he is no longer conscious of the body and the limbs as such. And therefore he does not take pride and pleasure in them.</p>

<p>With this perception of the non-existence of the body and limbs, he fully achieves the eleventh vipassan&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a, (sa&#7749;kh&#257;rupekkh&#257; &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a.)</p></dd>

		<dd>The primary elements: dh&#257;tu, 'element', is a force of Nature which behaves in accordance with the laws of Nature. The four primary elements literally translated above for the sake of brevity as 'earth, water, fire, and air elements' are:

<ol>
	<li>Pathav&#299;-dh&#257;tu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing hardness. (It is sometimestranslated as the element of solidity or of extension);</li>
	<li>&#256;po-dh&#257;tu: a force of Nature that has the attributes of causing cohesion and of causing fluidity. (It is sometimes translated as the element of cohesion);</li>
	<li>Tejo-dh&#257;tu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing heat or cold, i.e., thermal energy. (It is sometimes translated as the element of heat);</li>
	<li>V&#257;yo-dh&#257;tu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing motion or impetus. (It is sometimes translated as the element of motion).</li>
</ol>

<p>The Pathav&#299;-dh&#257;tu is predominant in the first twenty items of the list given in Section (4). The &#256;po-dh&#257;tu is predominant in the last twelve items. The Tejo-dh&#257;tu consists of four kinds of heat in the body and V&#257;yo dh&#257;tu consists of six kinds of V&#257;yo in the body.</p></dd>

He is, in fact, required to be mindful of all forms of passion &mdash; weak, medium, strong. In vipassan&#257;, it is a very important point. Whatever takes place in the six senses, however insignificant, however good or bad it is, he is required to be mindful of it. (Passion=pleasure in or craving for something).</dd>

<dt><a href='#fnt-57' id='fn-57'>57</a>.</dt>
		<dd>'Sa-uttara', and 'anuttara' are relative terms, indicating inferior and superior states of mind. A state of mind that has some other state of mind superior to it, and is therefore inferior, is sa-uttara citta; a state of mind that is superior to some other state of mind is anuttara citta. K&#257;m&#257;vacara citta, the state of mind of the sensuous realms, is inferior to the r&#363;pa and ar&#363;pa jh&#257;na states of mind. The r&#363;pa jh&#257;na state of mind is inferior to the ar&#363;pa jhana state of mind, but is superior to the k&#257;m&#257;vacara state of mind. In vipassan&#257; practice, the ar&#363;pa jh&#257;na state of mind is superior to both the r&#363;pa jh&#257;na and the kamavacara states of mind. Within the stages of the jh&#257;nas themselves, each jh&#257;na is relatively inferior or superior, progressing to the nevasa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;n&#257;sa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;yatana jh&#257;na which is the highest state of mind. An ordinary yogi who has no experience of jh&#257;na cannot concentrate on the mahaggara or anuttara states of mind.

<p>As a matter of fact, anuttara is normally an epithet for Lokuttar&#257; citta or Magga-phala citta. However, in vipassan&#257; practice, the yogi can concentrate only on the five up&#257;d&#257;nakkhandhas, the five Aggregates which form the objects of Clinging. He cannot concentrate on Magga-phala citta. Therefore, jh&#257;nas are given the epithet anuttara. (The Commentary)</p></dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-58' id='fn-58'>58</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Sam&#257;hita citta is the mind that has sam&#257;dhi, which is mental concentration on an object. According to the Commentary, Sam&#257;hita citta has (1) upac&#257;ra sam&#257;dhi, and (2) appan&#257; sam&#257;dhi, (i.e., jh&#257;na). Upac&#257;ra sam&#257;dhi is sam&#257;dhi that precedes, and is close to appan&#257; sam&#257;dhi, helping the latter to take place. Appan&#257; sam&#257;dhi fixes the mind on the mental object. The mind with upac&#257;ra sam&#257;dhi generally belongs to the sensuous state of existence. The mind with appan&#257; sam&#257;dhi belongs to the r&#363;pa (fine material) and ar&#363;pa (non-material) jh&#257;nas.</dd>

		<dd>N&#299;vara&#7751;a: means obstacles in the path of one's spiritual progress. They are hindrances to doing good deeds and to the achievement of jh&#257;nas and of the four Magga Insight, There are five Hindrances:

<p>(a) K&#257;macchanda: all forms of ta&#7751;h&#257;; and lobha, craving and desire.</p>

<p>(b) By&#257;p&#257;da: ill will; harbouring evil desires to ill-treat or destroy others, or to bring others into trouble.</p>

<p>(c) Thina-middha sloth and torpor; feeling or indolence, particularly for doing good and meritorious deeds.</p>

<p>(d) Uddhacca-kukkucca: distraction (or agitation) and worry. This has two aspects: flitting about of the mind (series of thought-moments) in all directions, and worrying over past commissions and omissions.</p>

<p>(e) Vicikicch&#257;: doubt or wavering of mind.</p></dd>

		<dd>And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-68' id='fn-68'>68</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The arising of the Hindrances is due to ayoniso manasik&#257;ra, wrong perception of phenomena, resulting from taking any phenomenon as permanent, pleasurable, endowed with soul, and non-repulsive. In the case of craving and desire, the N&#299;vara&#7751;a is due to taking what is actually repulsive as non-repulsive; in the case of ill will, the N&#299;vara&#7751;a is due to taking something as being offensive. The non-appearance or disappearance of the Hindrances is brought about by yoniso manasik&#257;ra, right perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable, soulless and repulsive.

<p>The discarded k&#257;macchanda will not rise again due to Arahatta Magga. The discarded by&#257;p&#257;da will not arise again due to An&#257;g&#257;mi Magga. The discarded thina-middha will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga. The discarded uddhacca-kukkucca will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga and An&#257;g&#257;mi Magga respectively.

<p>But the magga-phala citta (lokuttara citta) is not an object of Clinging. Therefore, only the vi&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;nakkhandh&#257; which does not include magga-phala citta can be the object of Clinging (up&#257;d&#257;na).</p></dd>

(see footnote on the Hindrances in Para 382); (vi) s&#299;labbatapar&#257;m&#257;sa, the misleading belief that there are paths, other than the Ariya Path of Eight Constituents, that can liberate one from dukkha; (vii) bhavar&#257;ga, craving to become a brahm&#257; with mind and body, (r&#363;par&#257;ga) or craving to become a brahm&#257; with only mind and no body (ar&#363;par&#257;ga); (viii) iss&#257;, jealousy, envy; (ix) macchariya, meanness and stinginess; (x) avijj&#257;, ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. This list is according to the Abhidhamma classification.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-76' id='fn-76'>76</a>.</dt>
		<dd>A fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise due to ayoniso-manasik&#257;ra; the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded through yoniso-manasik&#257;ra; due to one of the four Ariya Maggas the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-77' id='fn-77'>77</a>.</dt>
		<dd>And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-78' id='fn-78'>78</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The causes for the appearing of the physical sense-bases are ignorance of the four Noble Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment; and the dissolution of those physical sense-bases is due to the disappearance of these causes. The causes for the appearing and the dissolution of the mind base are the same as those for the Mind; (see footnote to Para 381). The causes for the appearing and the dissolution of the mind-object base, which are not already included in the physical sense-bases, are the same as those for Sensation; (see footnote to Para 380).</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-79' id='fn-79'>79</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Bojjha&#7749;g&#257;, pl. of bojjha&#7749;ga: from bodhi + a&#7749;ga. Bodhi=knowledge of the four Ariya Truths, Enlightenment, through vipassana insight, and magga-phala insight, A&#7749;ga factor leading to such knowledge. Bojjha&#7749;ga is generally translated as factor of enlightenment or enlightenment-factor.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-80' id='fn-80'>80</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Factors which enable one to comprehend the four Ariya Truths</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-81' id='fn-81'>81</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Sati-sambojjha&#7749;ga: This is a combination of three words, namely, sati=steadfast mindfulness + sam=well, positively, clearly + bojjha&#7749;ga= one of the seven bojjha&#7749;ga. Sati-sambojjha&#7749;ga is the bojjha&#7749;ga of steadfast mindfulness that enables one to comprehend clearly the four Ariya Truths.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-82' id='fn-82'>82</a>.</dt>
		<dd>This is due to yoniso manasik&#257;ra: yoniso =proper + manasik&#257;ra=attention to the object. (See footnote to para 382). This also applies to the three factors of enlightenment.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-83' id='fn-83'>83</a>.</dt>
		<dd>This is due to Arahatta-magga: the fourth and final stage of Magga Insight, Magga &ntilde;&#257;&#7751;a, in which all the kilesas, moral defilements, are eradicated. This also applies to the other factors of enlightenment.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-84' id='fn-84'>84</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Dhammavicaya is a combination of two words, namely, dhamma + vicaya. Dhamma means the five khandhas, or n&#257;mar&#363;pa, mental and physical phenomena. Vicaya means knowledge through proper investigation. Here, investigation means vipassan&#257; bh&#257;van&#257;. So dhammavicaya means knowledge of the true nature of the five khandhas by means of vipassan&#257; bh&#257;van&#257;.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-85' id='fn-85'>85</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Viriya-sambojjha&#7749;ga: Viriya means the right effort to be mindful. It is a well-balanced effort which is neither unduly strong nor unduly weak. If the effort is unduly weak, the bhikkhu cannot achieve mental concentration (sam&#257;dhi). If it is unduly strong, be will become so exhausted that sam&#257;dhi, which he has already achieved, can be impaired.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-86' id='fn-86'>86</a>.</dt>
		<dd>P&#299;ti: when one's viriya, effort, becomes well-balanced, after attaining sati, steadfast mindfulness, and dhamma-vicaya, knowledge of the true nature or n&#257;mar&#363;pa, one gets p&#299;ti, joy and satisfaction which may thrill one through and through.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-87' id='fn-87'>87</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Passaddhi- sambojjha&#7749;ga: After one has got p&#299;ti-sambojjha&#7749;ga, one naturally gets passaddhi-sambojjha&#7749;ga. Before this stage, one has to start the meditation process by making a definite effort to be steadfastly mindful. However, when this Passaddhi stage has been once reached, mindfulness takes place without much effort.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-88' id='fn-88'>88</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Sam&#257;dhi-sambojjha&#7749;ga is a logical consequence of p&#299;ti -sambojjha&#7749;ga and pasaddhi-sambojjha&#7749;ga. When the bhikkhu achieves it, he is instantly and closely aware of every object as it appears in his mind.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-89' id='fn-89'>89</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Upekkh&#257;-sambojjha&#7749;ga is a bojjha&#7749;ga that keeps a balance between saddh&#257; (faith) and pa&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257; (knowledge of the true nature of the five khandhas, by means or vipassan&#257; bh&#257;van&#257;. It also keeps a balance between viriya and sam&#257;dhi.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-90' id='fn-90'>90</a>.</dt>
		<dd>And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-91' id='fn-91'>91</a>.</dt>
		<dd>The arising of the Bojjha&#7749;ga, factors of enlightenment, is due to yoniso-manasik&#257;ra, right perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable, soulless and repulsive. The non-appearance or disappearance of a bojjha&#7749;ga is due to ayoniso-manasik&#257;ra, wrong perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as permanent, pleasurable, endowed with soul, and non repulsive.</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-92' id='fn-92'>92</a>.</dt>
		<dd>And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul</dd>
<dt><a href='#fnt-93' id='fn-93'>93</a>.</dt>
		<dd>Dukkha as a Noble Truth is left untranslated. &quot;Suffering&quot; and &quot;ill&quot; are inadequate renderings. Dukkha is inherent in existence. The five Aggregates which are the objects of Clinging therefore embody dukkha. Dukkha has connotations of impermanence, insubstantiality, unsatisfactoriness, emptiness, imperfection, insecurity, besides the obvious ones of suffering, physical pain (as in para 393) and mental affliction.</dd>

		<dd>K&#257;ma-ta&#7751;h&#257; is hankering after and becoming attached to pleasures of the senses. Bhava- ta&#7751;h&#257; is hankering after and becoming attached to continued existence, either the current sensual existence or a better and higher existence in the r&#363;pa (fine material) or ar&#363;pa (non-material) brahm&#257; realms, or becoming attached to the r&#363;pa and ar&#363;pa jh&#257;nas. Vibhava- ta&#7751;h&#257; is hankering after and becoming attached to the idea that there is no kamma for rebirth, and hence no future existence.</dd>

The Buddha describes how the development of continuous mindfulness of the four <i>satipatthana</i> ("foundations of mindfulness" or "frames of reference") &mdash; mindfulness of the body, of feelings, of the mind, and of mind-objects &mdash; can lead ultimately to full Awakening. [The text of this sutta is identical to that of the <a href='../mn/mn.010.than.html'>Satipatthana Sutta</a> (MN 10), except that the Majjhima version omits the exposition of the Four Noble Truths (sections 5a,b,c and d in part D of this version).]}

<h1>Translator's Introduction</h1>
<p>The word <i>"satipatthana"</i> is the name for an approach to meditation aimed at establishing <i>sati,</i> or mindfulness. The term sati is related to the verb <i>sarati,</i> to remember or to keep in mind. It is sometimes translated as non-reactive awareness, free from agendas, simply present with whatever arises, but the formula for satipatthana doesn't support that translation. Non-reactive awareness is actually an aspect of equanimity, a quality fostered in the course of satipatthana. The activity of satipatthana, however, definitely has a motivating agenda: the desire for Awakening, which is classed not as a cause of suffering, but as part of the path to its ending (see <a href="../sn/sn51/sn51.015.than.html">SN 51.15</a>). The role of mindfulness is to keep the mind properly grounded in the present moment in a way that will keep it on the path. To make an analogy, Awakening is like a mountain on the horizon, the destination to which you are driving a car. Mindfulness is what remembers to keep attention focused on the road to the mountain, rather than letting it stay focused on glimpses of the mountain or get distracted by other paths leading away from the road.</p>
<p>As a compound term, satipatthana can be broken down in two ways, either as <i>sati-patthana,</i> foundation of mindfulness; or as <i>sati-upatthana,</i> establishing of mindfulness. Scholars debate as to which is the proper interpretation, but in practice both provide useful food for thought.</p>
<p>The first interpretation focuses on the objects of the meditation practice, the focal points that provide mindfulness with a foundation &mdash; or, to use the more idiomatic English phrase adopted here, a frame of reference. Altogether there are four: the body in and of itself; feelings in and of themselves; mind in and of itself; and mental qualities in and of themselves. The "in and of itself" here is crucial. In the case of the body, for instance, it means viewing the body on its own terms rather than in terms of its function in the context of the world (for in that case the world would be the frame of reference). Dropping any concern for how the body's beauty, agility, or strength fits into the world, the meditator simply stays with the direct experience of its breathing, its movements, its postures, its elementary properties, and its inevitable decay. A similar principle applies to the other frames of reference.</p>
<p>The second interpretation of satipatthana &mdash; sati-upatthana &mdash; focuses on the process of the meditation practice, on how a frame of reference is established. This sutta gives three stages for this process, applied to each frame of reference. The first stage, as applied to the body, is this:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>The monk remains focused on the body in and of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, and mindful &mdash; putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>
</div>
<p>"Remaining focused" refers to the element of concentration in the practice, as the meditator holds to one particular frame of reference amid the conflicting currents of experience. "Ardent" refers to the effort put into the practice, trying to abandon unskillful states of mind and develop skillful ones in their stead, all the while trying to discern the difference between the two. "Alert" means being clearly aware of what is happening in the present. "Mindful," as mentioned above, means being able to keep the frame of reference continually in mind. As these qualities work together, they bring the mind to a solid state of concentration. Although satipatthana practice is often said to be separate from the practice of jhana, a number of suttas &mdash; such as MN 125 (not in this collection) and <a href="../an/an08/an08.063.than.html">AN 8.63</a> &mdash; equate the successful completion of this first stage with the attainment of the first level of jhana. This point is confirmed by the many suttas &mdash; <a href="../mn/mn.118.than.html">MN 118</a> among them &mdash; describing how the practice of satipatthana brings to completion the factors for Awakening, which coincide with the factors of jhana.</p>
<p>The second stage of satipatthana practice is this:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
One remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away with regard to the body.
</div>
<p>The "phenomena of origination and passing away" covers events either directly or indirectly related to one's chosen frame of reference. "Directly" means changes in the frame of reference itself. For instance, when focused on the body, one may notice the arising and passing away of breath sensations within it. "Indirectly," here, means events in any of the other three frames of reference as they relate to the body. For example, one might notice the arising and passing away of feelings of pleasure or mental states of irritation in connection to events in the body. Or one might notice lapses of mindfulness in one's focus on the body.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, if the origination and passing away is of neutral events such as the aggregates, one is directed simply to be aware of them as events, and to let them follow their natural course so as to see what factors accompany them and lead to their comings and goings. However, when skillful or unskillful mental qualities &mdash; such as the factors for Awakening or the Hindrances &mdash; arise and pass away, one is encouraged to foster the factors that strengthen jhana and eliminate the factors that weaken it. This means actively getting engaged in maximizing skillful mental qualities and minimizing unskillful ones. One thus develops insight into the process of origination and passing away by taking an active and sensitive role in the process, just as you learn about eggs by trying to cook with them, gathering experience from your successes and failures in attempting increasingly difficult dishes.</p>
<p>As this process leads to stronger and more refined states of concentration, it makes one sensitive to the fact that the grosser one's participation in the process of origination and passing away in the mind, the grosser the level of stress that results. This leads one to let go of increasingly refined levels of participation as one is able to detect them, leading to the third and final stage in satipatthana practice:</p>
<div class="excerpt">
<p>Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body (feeling, mind, mental quality)' is maintained [simply] to the extent of knowledge &amp; recollection. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world.</p>
</div>
<p>This stage corresponds to a mode of perception that the Buddha in <a href="../mn/mn.121.than.html">MN 121</a> terms "entry into emptiness":</p>
<div class="excerpt">
Thus he regards it [this mode of perception] as empty of whatever is not there. Whatever remains, he discerns as present: "there is this."
</div>
<p>This is the culminating equipoise where the path of the practice opens to a state of non-fashioning and from there to the fruit of Awakening and release.</p>
<p>At first glance, the four frames of reference for satipatthana practice sound like four different meditation exercises, but <a href="../mn/mn.118.than.html">MN 118</a> makes clear that they can all center on a single practice: keeping the breath in mind. When the mind is with the breath, all four frames of reference are right there. The difference lies simply in the subtlety of one's focus. It's like learning to play the piano. As you get more proficient at playing, you also become sensitive in listening to ever more subtle levels in the music. This allows you to play even more skillfully. In the same way, as a meditator gets more skilled in staying with the breath, the practice of satipatthana gives greater sensitivity in peeling away ever more subtle layers of participation in the present moment until nothing is left standing in the way of total release.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in the <a id="kuru">Kuru</a> country. Now there is a town of the Kurus called <a id="kammasadhamma">Kammasadhamma</a>. There the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Monks."</p>
<p>"Lord," the monks replied.</p>
<p>The Blessed One said this: "This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow &amp; lamentation, for the disappearance of pain &amp; distress, for the attainment of the right method, &amp; for the realization of Unbinding &mdash; in other words, the four frames of reference. Which four?</p>
<p>"There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings... mind... mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>

<h4><a id="body">A. Body</a></h4>
<p>"And how does a monk remain focused on the body in &amp; of itself?</p>
<p><b>[<a id="body1">1</a>]</b> "<a id="wild">There is</a> the case where a monk &mdash; having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building &mdash; sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore [lit: the front of the chest]. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.</p>
<p>"Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.' <a id='turner'>Just as</a> a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn, discerns, 'I am making a long turn,' or when making a short turn discerns, 'I am making a short turn'; in the same way the monk, when breathing in long, discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long' ... He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.'</p>
<p>"In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp; of itself, or externally on the body in &amp; of itself, or both internally &amp; externally on the body in &amp; of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away with regard to the body. Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge &amp; remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself.</p>
<p><b>[<a id="body2">2</a>]</b> "Furthermore, when walking, the monk discerns, 'I am walking.' When standing, he discerns, 'I am standing.' When sitting, he discerns, 'I am sitting.' When lying down, he discerns, 'I am lying down.' Or however his body is disposed, that is how he discerns it.</p>
<p>"In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp; of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself.</p>
<p><b>[<a id="body3">3</a>]</b> "Furthermore, when going forward &amp; returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward &amp; looking away... when bending &amp; extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe &amp; his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, &amp; savoring... when urinating &amp; defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, &amp; remaining silent, he makes himself fully alert.</p>
<p>"In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp; of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself.</p>
<p><b>[<a id="body4">4</a>]</b> "Furthermore... <a id="sack">just as</a> if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain &mdash; wheat, rice, mung beans, kidney beans, sesame seeds, husked rice &mdash; and a man with good eyesight, pouring it out, were to reflect, 'This is wheat. This is rice. These are mung beans. These are kidney beans. These are sesame seeds. This is husked rice,' in the same way, monks, a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up, from the crown of the head on down, surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things: 'In this body there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, gorge, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-oil, saliva, mucus, fluid in the joints, urine.'</p>

<p>"Or again, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground, picked at by crows, vultures, &amp; hawks, by dogs, hyenas, &amp; various other creatures... a skeleton smeared with flesh &amp; blood, connected with tendons... a fleshless skeleton smeared with blood, connected with tendons... a skeleton without flesh or blood, connected with tendons... bones detached from their tendons, scattered in all directions &mdash; here a hand bone, there a foot bone, here a shin bone, there a thigh bone, here a hip bone, there a back bone, here a rib, there a breast bone, here a shoulder bone, there a neck bone, here a jaw bone, there a tooth, here a skull... the bones whitened, somewhat like the color of shells... piled up, more than a year old... decomposed into a powder: He applies it to this very body, 'This body, too: Such is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate.'</p>

<h4>(<a id="feelings">B. Feelings</a>)</h4>
<p>"And how does a monk remain focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves? There is the case where a monk, when feeling a painful feeling, discerns, 'I am feeling a painful feeling.' When feeling a pleasant feeling, he discerns, 'I am feeling a pleasant feeling.' When feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he discerns, 'I am feeling a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.'</p>

<p>"And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves?</p>
<p><b>[<a id="mental1">1</a>]</b> "There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves with reference to the <i>five hindrances.</i> And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves with reference to the five hindrances? There is the case where, there being sensual desire present within, a monk discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me.' Or, there being no sensual desire present within, he discerns that 'There is no sensual desire present within me.' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire. And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen. And he discerns how there is no future arising of sensual desire that has been abandoned.

<p>"And what is right view? Knowledge with regard to stress, knowledge with regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress: This is called right view.</p>
<p>"And what is right resolve? Aspiring to renunciation, to freedom from ill will, to harmlessness: This is called right resolve.</p>
<p>"And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, &amp; from idle chatter: This is called right speech.</p>
<p>"And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from illicit sex. This is called right action.</p>
<p>"And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood.</p>
<p>"And what is right effort? There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen... for the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen... for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen... (and) for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen: This is called right effort.</p>
<p>"And what is right mindfulness? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves... the mind in &amp; of itself... mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. This is called right mindfulness.</p>
<p>"And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration.</p>
<p>"This is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.</p>
<p>"In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves, or externally on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves, or both internally &amp; externally on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities, or on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away with regard to mental qualities. Or his mindfulness that 'There are mental qualities' is maintained to the extent of knowledge &amp; remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves with reference to the four noble truths...</p>
<h4>(<a id="conclusion">E. Conclusion</a>)</h4>
<p>"Now, if anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven years, one of two fruits can be expected for him: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or &mdash; if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance &mdash; non-return.</p>
<p>"Let alone seven years. If anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for six years... five... four... three... two years... one year... seven months... six months... five... four... three... two months... one month... half a month, one of two fruits can be expected for him: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or &mdash; if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance &mdash; non-return.</p>
<p>"Let alone half a month. If anyone would develop these four frames of reference in this way for seven days, one of two fruits can be expected for him: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or &mdash; if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance &mdash; non-return.</p>
<p>"'This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow &amp; lamentation, for the disappearance of pain &amp; distress, for the attainment of the right method, &amp; for the realization of Unbinding &mdash; in other words, the four frames of reference.' Thus was it said, and in reference to this was it said."</p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

<h1>Translator's Introduction</h1>
<p>The body of this sutta consists of a narrative illustrating the power of skillful action.</p>
<p>In the past, unskillful behavior was unknown among the human race. As a result, people lived for an immensely long time &mdash; 80,000 years &mdash; endowed with great beauty, wealth, pleasure, and strength. Over the course of time, though, they began behaving in various unskillful ways. This caused the human life span gradually to shorten, to the point where it now stands at 100 years, with human beauty, wealth, pleasure, and strength decreasing proportionately. In the future, as morality continues to degenerate, human life will continue to shorten to the point were the normal life span is 10 years, with people reaching sexual maturity at five. "Among those human beings, the ten courses of action (see <a href="../an/an10/an10.176.than.html">AN 10.176</a>) will have entirely disappeared... The word 'skillful' will not exist, so from where will there be anyone who does what is skillful? Those who lack the honorable qualities of motherhood, fatherhood, contemplative-hood, &amp; brahman-hood will be the ones who receive homage... Fierce hatred will arise, fierce malevolence, fierce rage, &amp; murderous thoughts: mother for child, child for mother, father for child, child for father, brother for sister, sister for brother." Ultimately, conditions will deteriorate to the point of a "sword-interval," in which swords appear in the hands of all human beings, and they hunt one another like game. A few people, however, will take shelter in the wilderness to escape the carnage, and when the slaughter is over, they will come out of hiding and resolve to take up a life of skillful and virtuous action again. With the recovery of virtue, the human life span will gradually increase again until it reaches 80,000 years, with people attaining sexual maturity at 500. Only three diseases will be known at that time: desire, lack of food, and old age. Another Buddha &mdash; Metteyya (Maitreya) &mdash; will gain Awakening, his monastic Sangha numbering in the thousands. The greatest king of the time, Sankha, will go forth into homelessness and attain arahantship under Metteyya's guidance.</p>
<p>The story, after chronicling the ups and downs of human wealth, life span, etc., concludes with the following lesson on kamma and skillful action.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p>..."<a id="island">Monks</a>, live with yourself as your island, yourself as your refuge, with nothing else as your refuge. Live with the Dhamma as your island, the Dhamma as your refuge, with nothing else as your refuge. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> And how does a monk live with himself as his island, himself as his refuge, with nothing else as his refuge; with the Dhamma as his island, the Dhamma as his refuge, with nothing else as his refuge? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves... mind in &amp; of itself... mental qualities in &amp; of themselves &mdash; ardent, alert, &amp; mindful &mdash; putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. This is how a monk lives with himself as his island, himself as his refuge, with nothing else as his refuge; with the Dhamma as his island, the Dhamma as his refuge, with nothing else as his refuge.</p>
<p>"Wander, monks, in your proper range, your own ancestral territory. When you wander in your proper range, your own ancestral territory, you will grow in long life, beauty, pleasure, wealth, &amp; strength.</p>
<p>"And what constitutes a monk's long life? <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> There is the case where a monk develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire &amp; the fabrications of exertion. He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence... founded on intent... He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on discrimination &amp; the fabrications of exertion. From the development &amp; pursuit of these four bases of power, he can stay (alive) for an aeon, if he wants, or for the remainder of an aeon. This constitutes a monk's long life.</p>
<p>"And what constitutes a monk's beauty? There is the case where a monk is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in his behavior &amp; sphere of activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults. This constitutes a monk's beauty.</p>
<p>"And what constitutes a monk's pleasure? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This constitutes a monk's pleasure.</p>
<p>"And what constitutes a monk's wealth? There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction [the east] &mdash; as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth &mdash; with an awareness imbued with good will. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with good will: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.</p>
<p>"He keeps pervading the first direction &mdash; as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth &mdash; with an awareness imbued with compassion... imbued with appreciation...</p>
<p>"He keeps pervading the first direction &mdash; as well as the second direction, the third, &amp; the fourth &mdash; with an awareness imbued with equanimity. Thus he keeps pervading above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere &amp; in every respect the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with equanimity: abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.</p>
<p>"This constitutes a monk's wealth.</p>
<p>"And what constitutes a monk's strength? There is the case where a monk, through the ending of the mental fermentations, enters &amp; remains in the fermentation-free awareness-release &amp; discernment-release, having directly known &amp; realized them for himself right in the here &amp; now. This constitutes a monk's strength.</p>
<p>"Monks, I don't envision any other single strength so hard to overcome as this: the strength of Mara. <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> And the adopting of skillful qualities is what causes this merit to increase." <a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4'>[4]</a></p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<dl>
<dt><a href="#fnt-1" id="fn-1">1</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This can also be translated as: "Live with mental qualities (dhammas) as your island, mental qualities as your refuge, with nothing else as your refuge."</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-2" id="fn-2">2</a>.</dt>
	<dd>Literally, "what is in a monk's long life?" This appears to be an idiomatic usage of the locative case. The commentary interprets this idiom as meaning, what <i>causes</i> a monk's long life, beauty, etc. From this reading, it explains, for example, that a monk attracts wealth if he develops the four sublime attitudes. While this is true, it seems to cheapen the message of this passage.</dd>
<dt><a href="#fnt-3" id="fn-3">3</a>.</dt>
	<dd>This last passage is related to the opening passage of the sutta, in which the Buddha says, "Wander, monks, in your proper range, your own ancestral territory. When one wanders in his proper range, his own ancestral territory, Mara gains no opening, Mara gains no foothold. And it is because of adopting skillful qualities that this merit increases." See also <a href="../sn/sn47/sn47.006.than.html">SN 47.6-7</a>.</dd>

	<dd>This is the refrain repeated with each stage in the account of how human life will improve in the aftermath of the sword-interval. Here, "merit" seems to have the meaning it has in <a href="../kn/iti/iti.1.001-027.than.html#iti-022">Iti 22</a>: "Don't be afraid of acts of merit." This is another way of saying what is blissful, desirable, pleasing, endearing, charming &mdash; i.e., acts of merit.</dd>

<div class="chapter">
<p>This is what I heard.</p>

<p>1. On one occasion, the Buddha<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> was living near the town of Rajagaha<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a> at a spot in the Bamboo Grove called the Squirrel's Feeding Place.</p>

<p>At that time a young householder named Sigalaka arose early and set out from Rajagaha with freshly washed clothes and hair.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-3' id='fnt-3'>[3]</a> With palms together held up in reverence,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-4' id='fnt-4'>[4]</a> he was paying respect towards the six directions:<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5'>[5]</a> that is east, south, west, north, lower and upper.</p>

<p>2. Meanwhile the Buddha dressed himself in the early morning, took his bowl and robe and went in to Rajagaha on alms round. On the way, he saw Sigalaka worshipping the six directions. Seeing this, the Buddha said to him: "Young man, why have you risen in the early morning and set out from Rajagaha to worship in such a way?"</p>

<p>"Dear sir, my father on his deathbed urged me, 'My son, you must worship the directions'. So, dear sir, realizing, honoring, respecting, and holding sacred my father's request, I have risen in the early morning and set out from Rajagaha to worship in this way."</p>

<p>"But, young man, that is not how the six directions should be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble ones."</p>

<p>"Then how, dear sir, should the six directions be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble ones? I would appreciate it if you would teach me the proper way this should be done."</p>

<p>"Very well, young man, listen and pay careful attention while I tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear sir," agreed Sigalaka.</p>

<p>The Buddha said this:</p>

<p>3. "Young man, by abandoning the four impure actions, a noble disciple refrains from harmful deeds rooted in four causes and avoids the six ways of squandering wealth. So, these fourteen harmful things are removed. The noble disciple, now with the six directions protected, has entered upon a path for conquering both worlds, firmly grounded in this world and the next. At the dissolution of the body after death, a good rebirth occurs in a heavenly world.</p>

<p>"What four impure actions are abandoned? The harming of living beings is an impure action, taking what is not given is an impure action, sexual misconduct is an impure action, and false speech is an impure action.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-6' id='fnt-6'>[6]</a> These four are abandoned."</p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p>4. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>


<div class='freeverse'>
"Harming living beings, taking what is not given,
False speech, and pursuing the loved one of another:
These the wise surely do not praise."
</div>


<p>5. "What are the four causes of harmful deeds? Going astray through desire, hatred, delusion, or fear, the noble disciple does harmful deeds. But, young man, not going astray through desire, hatred, delusion, or fear, the noble disciple does not perform harmful deeds."</p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p>6. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>


<div class='freeverse'>
"Desire, hatred, delusion, or fear:
Whoever transgresses the Dhamma by these,
Has a reputation that comes to ruin,
Like the moon in the waning fortnight.

Desire, hatred, delusion, or fear:
Whoever transgresses not the Dhamma by these,
Has a reputation that comes to fullness,
Like the moon in the waxing fortnight."
</div>


<p>7. "And what six ways of squandering wealth are to be avoided? Young man, heedlessness caused by intoxication, roaming the streets at inappropriate times, habitual partying, compulsive gambling, bad companionship, and laziness are the six ways of squandering wealth.</p>

<p>8. "These are the six dangers inherent in heedlessness caused by intoxication: loss of immediate wealth, increased quarreling, susceptibility to illness, disrepute, indecent exposure, and weakened insight.</p>

<p>9. "These are the six dangers inherent in roaming the streets at inappropriate times: oneself, one's family, and one's property are all left unguarded and unprotected; one is suspected of crimes; then rumors spread; and one is subjected to many miseries.</p>

<p>10. "These are the six dangers inherent in habitual partying: You constantly seek, 'Where's the dancing? Where's the singing? Where's the music? Where are the stories? Where's the applause? Where's the drumming?'</p>

<p>11. "These are the six dangers inherent in compulsive gambling: winning breeds resentment; the loser mourns lost property; savings are lost; one's word carries no weight in a public forum; friends and colleagues display their contempt; and one is not sought after for marriage, since a gambler cannot adequately support a family.</p>

<p>12. "These are the six dangers inherent in bad companionship: any rogue, drunkard, addict, cheat, swindler, or thug becomes a friend and colleague.</p>

<p>13. "These are the six dangers inherent in laziness: saying, 'It's too cold,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too hot,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too late,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too early,' one does not work; saying, 'I'm too hungry,' one does not work; saying, 'I'm too full,' one does not work. With an abundance of excuses for not working, new wealth does not accrue and existing wealth goes to waste."</p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p>14. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>


<div class='freeverse'>
"Some are drinking buddies,
Some say, 'Dear friend! Dear friend!'.
But whoever in hardship stands close by,
That one truly is a friend.

Sleeping late, adultery,
Hostility, meaninglessness,
Harmful friends, utter stinginess:
These six things destroy a person.

Bad friends, bad companions,
Bad practices &mdash; spending time in evil ways,
By these, one brings oneself to ruin,
In this world and the next.

Seduction, gambling, drinking, singing, dancing,
Sleeping by day, wandering all around untimely,
Harmful friends, utter stinginess:
These things destroy a person.

They play with dice; they drink spirits;
They consort with lovers dear to others.
Associating with low-life and not the esteemed,
They come to ruin like the waning moon.

Whoever is a drunkard, broke, and destitute,
Dragged by thirst from bar to bar,
Sinking into debt like a stone in water
Into bewilderment quickly plunges.

When sleeping late becomes a habit
And night is seen as time to rise,
For one perpetually intoxicated,
A home life cannot be maintained.

'Too cold! Too hot!
Too late!': they say.
Having wasted work time this way,
The young miss out on opportunities.

For one regarding cold and hot
As not more than blades of grass,
Doing whatever should be done,
Happiness will not be a stranger."
</div>


<p>15. "Young man, be aware of these four enemies disguised as friends: the taker, the talker, the flatterer, and the reckless companion.</p>

<p>16. "The taker can be identified by four things: by only taking, asking for a lot while giving little, performing duty out of fear, and offering service in order to gain something.</p>

<p>17. "The talker can be identified by four things: by reminding of past generosity, promising future generosity, mouthing empty words of kindness, and protesting personal misfortune when called on to help.</p>

<p>18. "The flatterer can be identified by four things: by supporting both bad and good behavior indiscriminately, praising you to your face, and putting you down behind your back.</p>

<p>19. "The reckless companion can be identified by four things: by accompanying you in drinking, roaming around at night, partying, and gambling."</p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p>20. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>


<div class='freeverse'>
"The friend who is all take,
The friend of empty words,
The friend full of flattery,
And the reckless friend;

These four are not friends, but enemies;
The wise understand this
And keep them at a distance
As they would a dangerous path."
</div>


<p>21. "Young man, be aware of these four good-hearted friends: the helper, the friend who endures in good times and bad, the mentor, and the compassionate friend.</p>

<p>22. "The helper can be identified by four things: by protecting you when you are vulnerable, and likewise your wealth, being a refuge when you are afraid, and in various tasks providing double what is requested.</p>

<p>23. "The enduring friend can be identified by four things: by telling you secrets, guarding your own secrets closely, not abandoning you in misfortune, and even dying for you.</p>

<p>24. "The mentor can be identified by four things: by restraining you from wrongdoing, guiding you towards good actions, telling you what you ought to know, and showing you the path to heaven.</p>

<p>25. "The compassionate friend can be identified by four things: by not rejoicing in your misfortune, delighting in your good fortune, preventing others from speaking ill of you, and encouraging others who praise your good qualities."</p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p>26. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>


<div class='freeverse'>
"The friend who is a helper,
The friend through thick and thin,
The friend who gives good counsel,
And the compassionate friend;

These four are friends indeed,
The wise understand this
And attend on them carefully,
Like a mother her own child.

The wise endowed with virtue
Shine forth like a burning fire,
Gathering wealth as bees do honey
And heaping it up like an ant hill.
Once wealth is accumulated,
Family and household life may follow.

By dividing wealth into four parts,
True friendships are bound;
One part should be enjoyed;
Two parts invested in business;
And the fourth set aside
Against future misfortunes."
</div>


<p>27. "And how, young man, does the noble disciple protect the six directions? These six directions should be known: mother and father as the east, teachers as the south, spouse and family as the west, friends and colleagues as the north, workers and servants as the lower direction, and ascetics and Brahmans as the upper direction.</p>

<p>28. "In five ways should a mother and father as the eastern direction be respected by a child: 'I will support them who supported me; I will do my duty to them; I will maintain the family lineage and tradition; I will be worthy of my inheritance; and I will make donations on behalf of dead ancestors.'</p>

<p>"And, the mother and father so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways: by restraining you from wrongdoing, guiding you towards good actions, training you in a profession, supporting the choice of a suitable spouse, and in due time, handing over the inheritance.</p>

<p>"In this way, the eastern direction is protected and made peaceful and secure.</p>

<p>29. "In five ways should teachers as the southern direction be respected by a student: by rising for them, regularly attending lessons, eagerly desiring to learn, duly serving them, and receiving instruction.</p>

<p>"And, teachers so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways: by training in self-discipline, ensuring the teachings are well-grasped, instructing in every branch of knowledge, introducing their friends and colleagues, and providing safeguards in every direction.</p>

<p>"In this way, the southern direction is protected and made peaceful and secure.</p>

<p>30. "In five ways should a wife as the western direction be respected by a husband: by honoring, not disrespecting, being faithful, sharing authority, and by giving gifts.</p>

<p>"And, the wife so respected reciprocates with compassion in five ways: by being well-organized, being kindly disposed to the in-laws and household workers, being faithful, looking after the household goods, and being skillful and diligent in all duties.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-7' id='fnt-7'>[7]</a></p>

<p>In this way, the western direction is protected and made peaceful and secure.</p>

<p>31. "In five ways should friends and colleagues as the northern direction be respected: by generosity, kind words, acting for their welfare, impartiality, and honesty.</p>

<p>"And, friends and colleagues so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways: by protecting you when you are vulnerable, and likewise your wealth, being a refuge when you are afraid, not abandoning you in misfortunes, and honoring all your descendants.</p>

<p>"In this way, the northern direction is protected and made peaceful and secure.</p>

<p><a id="para-32"></a>32. "In five ways should workers and servants as the lower direction be respected by an employer: by allocating work according to aptitude, providing wages and food, looking after the sick, sharing special treats, and giving reasonable time off work.</p>

<p>"And, workers and servants so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways: being willing to start early and finish late when necessary, taking only what is given, doing work well, and promoting a good reputation.</p>

<p>"In this way, the lower direction is protected and made peaceful and secure.</p>

<p>33. "In five ways should ascetics and Brahmans as the upper direction be respected: by kindly actions, speech, and thoughts, having an open door, and providing material needs.</p>

<p>"And, ascetics and Brahmans so respected reciprocate with compassion in six ways: by restraining you from wrongdoing, guiding you to good actions, thinking compassionately, telling you what you ought to know, clarifying what you already know, and showing you the path to heaven.</p>

<p>"In this way, the upper direction is protected and made peaceful and secure."</p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p>34. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>


<div class='freeverse'>
"Mother and father as the east,
Teachers as the south,
Spouse and family as the west,
Friends and colleagues as the north,
Servants and workers below,
Brahmans and ascetics above;
These directions a person should honor
In order to be truly good.

Wise and virtuous,
Gentle and eloquent,
Humble and accommodating;
Such a person attains glory.

Energetic, not lazy,
Not shaken in misfortune,
Flawless in conduct, and intelligent;
Such a person attains glory.

A compassionate maker of friends,
Approachable, free from stinginess,
A leader, a teacher, and diplomat;
Such a person attains glory.

Generosity and kind words,
Conduct for others' welfare,
Impartiality in all things;
These are suitable everywhere.

These kind dispositions hold the world together,
Like the linchpin of a moving chariot.
And should these kind dispositions not exist,
Then the mother would not receive
Respect or honor from her child,
Neither would a father.

Upon these things
The wise reflect;
They obtain greatness
And are sources of praise."
</div>


<p>35. When all was said, the young householder, Sigalaka, exclaimed to the Buddha:</p>

<p>"Wonderful, dear sir! Wonderful! It is as though you have set upright what was overturned, or uncovered what was concealed, or shown the path to one gone astray, or brought an oil-lamp into the darkness such that those with eyes could see. So too has the Buddha made clear the Dhamma by various ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha and to the Dhamma and to the monastic community.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-8' id='fnt-8'>[8]</a> May the exalted one accept me as a lay-follower gone for refuge from henceforth for as long as I live."</p>

	<dd>Throughout the text the word used to signify the Buddha is <i>Bhagavant</i>, a Pali word meaning "Blessed One" or "Fortunate One". To make the language clearer for modern audiences we have chosen to just use "the Buddha".</dd>

	<dd>Sigalaka's freshly washed clothes and hair perhaps highlight that he has just performed the Vedic bathing ritual of <i>tarpa.na</i>. While chanting mantras, the bather would cup his hands with water and then allow it to flow back into the river. Following the ablution, he dresses in clean clothes. (See Klaus K. Klostermaier, <i>A Survey of Hinduism</i>, 2nd ed. (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), Chitrabhanu Sen, <i>A Dictionary of the Vedic Rituals: Based on the Srauta and Grhya Sutras</i> (New Delhi: Concept Publishing Company, 1978).)</dd>

	<dd>More specifically, Sigalaka is worshipping with joined hands outstretched.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-5" id="fn-5">5</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The Pali words denoting the six directions have obvious symbolic implications in relation to the six groups of people that the Buddha associates with them. <i>Puratthima </i>("east") derives from the Sanskrit word <i>purastaat</i>, which in addition to denoting the east, means "before, forward, in or from the front;... in the beginning" (Monier Monier-Williams, Carl Cappeller, and Ernst Leumann, <i>A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages</i>, New ed. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2002), 634.). The parents are represented in the east, as they are our beginning. <i>Dakkhi.na</i>, the south, also means "the right (as opposed to the left)" (T. W. Rhys Davids and Wilhelm Stede, <i>The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary</i> (Oxford: Pali Text Society, 1999), 311.). The right side, considered as respectful, aptly represents the teachers. As the sun sets in the west, <i>pacchima</i> symbolizes the conclusion of one's life where one's own spouse and family are found. While the Pali word <i>he.t.thima</i>, denoting the lower direction, does not give great symbolic context, a Sanskrit equivalent, <i>dhruva</i>, in the Atharva-Veda (AV) III.26, 27 does. As six directions are mentioned only in three Sanskrit texts, these references are important. The adjective <i>dhruva</i>, when taken with <i>di"s</i>, as it is here, means "the point of the heavens directly under the feet" (Monier-Williams, Cappeller, and Leumann, <i>A Sanskrit-English Dictionary</i>, 521.). As servants and slaves represent the direction underfoot in the <i>Si"ngalovada-Suttanta</i>, a clear image of social inferiority emerges with the under-classes literally being trodden on. <i>Uparima</i>, the uppermost direction, represents the Brahmans and ascetics, who may be seen as being closer to heaven and spiritually higher than the layperson.</dd>

<dt><a href="#fnt-6" id="fn-6">6</a>.</dt>
	<dd>The impure actions which are abandoned by the noble disciple constitute the first four of five precepts taken by laypeople which make up the <i>siila</i>, or morality, group referred to in the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path, that is, Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood. <i>Siila</i> is a prerequisite for the other path groups (the <i>samaadhi</i>, concentration, group and the <i>pa~n~naa</i>, wisdom, group) for a very practical reason; the remorse and guilt that disturb the mind of an immoral person make meditation, and thus progress towards awakening, impossible. The five precepts can be baldly stated as: 1) not taking life; 2) not stealing; 3) not committing adultery; 4) not lying; and 5) not taking intoxicants. However, they go beyond a simple list of prohibitions and offer a model lifestyle that develops the qualities of an awakened person. So not taking life holds within it the implication of an active determination to preserve life, to live with care and consideration for the well-being of others. Not stealing implies a sensitivity for the possessions of others (both material and otherwise), as well as for the natural resources available in nature. Not committing adultery also means committing to one's relationship wholeheartedly. Not lying connotes a reverence for the truth as well as for the value of gentle, mild speech. Taking intoxicants is to risk breaking all of the other precepts through heedlessness, and so is to be avoided. Maintaining <i>siila</i> is a private matter for individuals; there is no authority meting out punishment for non-observance. One able to maintain the precepts is one who lives a careful, considerate, and mindful existence, most conducive to the development of concentration, wisdom, and ultimately <i>nibbaana</i>. The latter of course is the Buddha's real goal for his students, a goal that goes far beyond mindless adherence to a set of rules.</dd>

	<dd>It may be significant to note that the Pali continually uses the word "and" to connect the duties of the wife as well as those of the servants and workers in <a href="#para-32">paragraph 32</a>. Could this be because these people were considered socially inferior?</dd>

<div class="chapter">
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary, near <a id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>.</p>
<p>Now at that time, young <a id="sigala">Sigala</a>, a householder's son, rising early in the morning, departing from Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worshipped with joined hands the various quarters &mdash; the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir, and the Zenith.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One, having robed himself in the forenoon took bowl and robe, and entered Rajagaha for alms. Now he saw young Sigala worshipping thus and spoke to him as follows:</p>
<p>"Wherefore do you, young householder, rising early in the morning, departing from Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worship, with joined hands these various quarters &mdash; the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir, and the Zenith?"</p>
<p>"My father, Lord, while dying, said to me: The six quarters, dear son, you shall worship. And I, Lord, respecting, revering, reverencing and honoring my father's word, rise early in the morning, and leaving Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worship with joined hands, these six quarters."</p>
<p>"It is not thus, young householder, the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble."</p>
<p>"How then, Lord, should the six quarters be worshipped in the discipline of the noble? It is well, Lord, if the Exalted One would teach the doctrine to me showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble."</p>
<p>"Well, young householder, listen and bear it well in mind; I shall speak." &mdash; "Very good, Lord," responded young Sigala.</p>
<p>And the Exalted One spoke as follows:</p>
<p>"Inasmuch, young householder, as the noble disciple <b>(1)</b> has eradicated the four vices in conduct,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-1' id='fnt-1'>[1]</a> <b>(2)</b> inasmuch as he commits no evil action in four ways, <b>(3)</b> inasmuch as he pursues not the six channels for dissipating wealth, he thus, avoiding these fourteen evil things, covers the six quarters, and enters the path leading to victory in both worlds: he is favored in this world and in the world beyond. Upon the dissolution of the body, after death, he is born in a happy heavenly realm.</p>
<p><b>(1)</b> "What are <a id="vices4">the four vices</a> in conduct that he has eradicated? The destruction of life, householder, is a vice and so are stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying. These are the four vices that he has eradicated."</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
Killing, stealing, lying and adultery,
These four evils the wise never praise.
</div>
<p><b>(2)</b> "In which four ways does one commit no evil action? Led by desire does one commit evil. Led by anger does one commit evil. Led by ignorance does one commit evil. Led by fear does one commit evil.<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-2' id='fnt-2'>[2]</a></p>
<p>"But inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by desire, anger, ignorance, and fear, he commits no evil."</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
<a id="moon">Whoever</a> through desire, hate or fear,
Or ignorance should transgress the Dhamma,
All his glory fades away
Like the moon during the waning half.
Whoever through desire, hate or fear,
Or ignorance never transgresses the Dhamma,
All his glory ever increases
Like the moon during the waxing half.
</div>
<p><b>(3)</b> "What are the six channels for dissipating wealth which he does not pursue?</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
<b>(a)</b> "indulgence in intoxicants which cause infatuation and heedlessness;
<b>(b)</b> sauntering in streets at unseemly hours;
<b>(c)</b> frequenting theatrical shows;
<b>(d)</b> indulgence in gambling which causes heedlessness;
<b>(e)</b> association with evil companions;
<b>(f)</b> the habit of idleness.
</div>
<p><a id="intox"><b>(a)</b></a> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in indulging in intoxicants which cause infatuation and heedlessness:</p>

(iii) loss of wealth,

(vi) he is not sought after for matrimony; for people would say he is a gambler and is not fit to look after a wife.
</div>
<p><b>(e)</b> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in associating with evil companions, namely: any gambler, any libertine, any drunkard, any swindler, any cheat, any rowdy is his friend and companion.</p>

(v) that he is extremely hungry,
(vi) that he is too full.
</div>
<p>"Living in this way, he leaves many duties undone, new wealth he does not get, and wealth he has acquired dwindles away."</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<p>"One is a bottle friend; one says, 'friend, friend' only to one's face; one is a friend and an associate only when it is advantageous.</p>
<p>"Sleeping till sunrise, adultery, irascibility, malevolence, evil companions, avarice &mdash; these six causes ruin a man.</p>
<p>"The man who has evil comrades and friends is given to evil ways, to ruin does he fall in both worlds &mdash; here and the next.</p>
<p>"Dice, women, liquor, dancing, singing, sleeping by day, sauntering at unseemly hours, evil companions, avarice &mdash; these nine<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-5' id='fnt-5'>[5]</a> causes ruin a man.</p>
<p>"<a id="waning">Who plays</a> with dice and drinks intoxicants, goes to women who are dear unto others as their own lives, associates with the mean and not with elders &mdash; he declines just as the moon during the waning half.</p>
<p>"Who is drunk, poor, destitute, still thirsty whilst drinking, frequents the bars, sinks in debt as a stone in water, swiftly brings disrepute to his family.</p>
<p>"Who by habit sleeps by day, and keeps late hours, is ever intoxicated, and is licentious, is not fit to lead a household life.</p>
<p>"Who says it is too hot, too cold, too late, and leaves things undone, the opportunities for good go past such men.</p>
<p>"But he who does not regard cold or heat any more than a blade of grass and who does his duties manfully, does not fall away from happiness."</p>

(i) he is a companion in indulging in intoxicants that cause
infatuation and heedlessness,
(ii) he is a companion in sauntering in streets at unseemly hours,
(iii) he is a companion in frequenting theatrical shows,
(iv) he is a companion in indulging in gambling which causes heedlessness."
</div>
<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
The friend who appropriates,
the friend who renders lip-service,
the friend that flatters,
the friend who brings ruin,
these four as enemies the wise behold,
avoid them from afar as paths of peril.
</div>
<p>"These four, young householder, should be understood as warm-hearted friends:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
<b>(1)</b> he who is a helpmate,
<b>(2)</b> he who is the same in happiness and sorrow,
<b>(3)</b> he who gives good counsel,
<b>(4)</b> he who sympathises.
</div>
<p><b>(1)</b> "In four ways, young householder, should a helpmate be understood as a warm-hearted friend:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
(i) he guards the heedless,
(ii) he protects the wealth of the heedless,
(iii) he becomes a refuge when you are in danger,
(iv) when there are commitments he provides you with double the
supply needed.
</div>
<p><b>(2)</b> "In four ways, young householder, should one who is the same in happiness and sorrow be understood as a warm-hearted friend:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
(i) he reveals his secrets,
(ii) he conceals one's own secrets,
(iii) in misfortune he does not forsake one,
(iv) his life even he sacrifices for one's sake.
</div>
<p><b>(3)</b> "In four ways, young householder, should one who gives good counsel be understood as a warm-hearted friend:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
(i) he restrains one from doing evil,
(ii) he encourages one to do good,
(iii) he informs one of what is unknown to oneself,
(iv) he points out the path to heaven.
</div>
<p><b>(4)</b> "In four ways, young householder, should one who sympathises be understood as a warm-hearted friend:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
(i) he does not rejoice in one's misfortune,
(ii) he rejoices in one's prosperity,
(iii) he restrains others speaking ill of oneself,
(iv) he praises those who speak well of oneself."
</div>
<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
The friend who is a helpmate,
the friend in happiness and woe,
the friend who gives good counsel,
the friend who sympathises too  &mdash;
these four as friends the wise behold
and cherish them devotedly
as does a mother her own child.

The wise and virtuous shine like a blazing fire.
He who acquires his wealth in harmless ways
like to a bee that honey gathers,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-6' id='fnt-6'>[6]</a> 
riches mount up for him
like ant hill's rapid growth.

With wealth acquired this way,
a layman fit for household life,
in portions four divides his wealth:
thus will he friendship win.

One portion for his wants he uses,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-7' id='fnt-7'>[7]</a> 
two portions on his business spends,
the fourth for times of need he keeps.
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<p>"And how, young householder, does a noble disciple cover the six quarters?</p>
<p>"The following should be looked upon as the six quarters.

</div>
<p>"The friends and associates thus ministered to as the <b>North</b> by a clansman show their compassion towards him in these five ways. Thus is the <b>North</b> covered by him and made safe and secure.</p>
<p>"In five ways <a id="to-servant">should</a> a master minister to his servants and employees as the <b>Nadir</b>:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
(i) by assigning them work according to their ability,
(ii) by supplying them with food and with wages,
(iii) by tending them in sickness,
(iv) by sharing with them any delicacies,

<div class='freeverse'>
(i) by lovable deeds,

</div>
<p>"In these six ways do ascetics and brahmans show their compassion towards a householder who ministers to them as the <b>Zenith</b>. Thus is the <b>Zenith</b> covered by him and made safe and secure." Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<div class='freeverse'>
The mother and father are the East,
The Teachers are the South,
Wife and Children are the West,
The friends and associates are the North.

Servants and employees are the Nadir,
The ascetics and brahmans are the Zenith;
Who is fit to lead the household life,
These six quarters he should salute.

Who is wise and virtuous,
Gentle and keen-witted,
Humble and amenable,
Such a one to honor may attain.

Who is energetic and not indolent,
In misfortune unshaken,
Flawless in manner and intelligent,
Such a one to honor may attain.

Who is hospitable, and friendly,
Liberal and unselfish,
A guide, an instructor, a leader,
Such a one to honor may attain.

Generosity, sweet speech,
Helpfulness to others,
Impartiality to all,
As the case demands.

These four winning ways make the world go round,
As the linchpin in a moving car.
If these in the world exist not,
Neither mother nor father will receive,
Respect and honor from their children.

Since these four winning ways
The wise appraise in every way,
To eminence they attain,
And praise they rightly gain.
</div>
<p>When the Exalted One had spoken thus, Sigala, the young householder, said as follows:</p>
<p>"<a id="magnif">Excellent</a>, Lord, excellent! It is as if, Lord, a man were to set upright that which was overturned, or were to reveal that which was hidden, or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray, or were to hold a lamp amidst the darkness, so that those who have eyes may see. Even so, has the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted One.</p>
<p>"I take refuge, Lord, in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. May the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower; as one who has taken refuge from this very day to life's end."</p>

Merit of these good actions is offered to the departed after such ceremony. Moreover after every <i>punna-kamma</i> (good action), a Buddhist never fails to think of his parents and offer merit.

<p>Then four great kings<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-2' id='fnt-s24-2'>[2]</a> having placed a guard over the four quarters, with a large army of Yakkhas, of Gandhabbas, of Kumbhandas, of Nagas; having placed troops; having placed a barricade of soldiers on four sides, came to the presence of the Blessed One, when the night was far advanced, illuminating the entire Vulture's Peak with their surpassing radiance, saluted the Blessed One and sat on one side. From among the (attendant) Yakkhas, some saluted the Blessed One, and sat on one side; some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One conversing in a friendly and courteous manner, and sat on one side; some saluted him with clasped hands, and sat on one side; some announced their name and lineage, and sat on one side; some sat on one side in silence.</p>
<p>Then the great King Vessavana (Skt. Vaisravana<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-3' id='fnt-s24-3'>[3]</a>), who was seated on one side, said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p>"Venerable Sir (bhante), there are eminent Yakkhas who are not pleased with the Blessed One, there are also eminent Yakkhas pleased with the Blessed One. There are Yakkhas of middle rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One, and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed One. There are Yakkhas of inferior rank who are not pleased with the Blessed One, and there are those who are pleased with the Blessed One. The Yakkhas, bhante, as a rule, are not pleased with the Blessed One. What is the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"Well, the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma to establish abstention from killing, from stealing, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor that causes intoxication and negligence. To them such teaching is unpleasant and unpalatable."</p>
<p>"Surely bhante, there are disciples of the Blessed One. They frequent the remote recesses of forest and woodland wilderness where there is no sound, no tumult, where breezes are void of human contact, and suitable for man's seclusion and quiet contemplation. There are eminent Yakkhas who haunt these forests, who have no faith in the word of the Blessed One.</p>
<p>"Bhante, may the Blessed One learn the Atanata<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-4' id='fnt-s24-4'>[4]</a> protection so that the displeased Yakkhas may be pleased, so that the monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, may be at ease, guarded, protected and unharmed."</p>
<p>The Blessed One gave consent by his silence. Then the great King Vessavana, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, recited the Atanatiya protection:</p>
<p>1. "Homage to Vipassi (the Buddha) possessed of the eye (of wisdom) and splendor. Homage to Sikhi (the Buddha) compassionate towards all beings.</p>
<p>2. "Homage to Vessabhu (the Buddha) free from all defilements and possessed of ascetic energy. Homage to Kakusanda (the Buddha), the conqueror of (the five-fold) host of Mara.</p>
<p>3. "Homage to Konagamana (the Buddha) who has shed all defilements, and had lived the holy life. Homage to Kassapa (the Buddha) who is fully freed from all defilements.</p>
<p>4. "Homage to Angirasa (the Buddha Gotama), the son of the Sakyas, who is full of radiance, and who proclaimed the Dhamma that dispels all suffering.</p>
<p>5. "Those in the world, who have extinguished (the flames of passion), and have perceived through insight (meditation), things as they really are, they never slander anyone; they are mighty men who are free from fear.</p>
<p>6. "Gotama (the Buddha) dear to gods and men, endowed with knowledge and virtue,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-5' id='fnt-s24-5'>[5]</a> mighty and fearless, all do homage to him (homage be to him).</p>
<p>7-8. "When the resplendent sun &mdash; offspring of Aditi &mdash; with its full orb, arises, then the night ceases, and it is called the day. The direction from which the sun rises (is the East). There exists the ocean deep and vast.</p>
<p>9. "This &mdash; a spreading sheet of water &mdash; they know as the ocean. Where there is East (to the East of Mount Meru) they say that quarter is East.</p>
<p>10. "Custodian of this quarter is a great king named Dhatarattha who has a retinue of attendants, and is sovereign lord of the Gandhabbas.</p>
<p>11. "Attended by Ghandhabbas he enjoys their song and dance. Many are his (Datharatta's) sons, all of one name, so have I heard.</p>
<p>12-13. "Eighty and ten and one are they, Inda their name, and mighty are they. They too, beholding the Buddha &mdash; Kinsman of the sun, mighty and fearless &mdash; salute him from afar: "Homage to thee, who art unique among mankind; glory to thee, the noblest among men."<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-6' id='fnt-s24-6'>[6]</a></p>
<p>14-15. "As by thy omniscience,<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-7' id='fnt-s24-7'>[7]</a> thou hast looked on (mankind with a knowing eye), even the non-humans pay reverence to thee. This we have often heard. We, therefore, request the Yakkhas to pay homage to Gotama, the Conqueror (the Buddha). They too say: 'We reverence Gotama, the Conqueror, we reverence Gotama who is endowed with knowledge and virtue.'"</p>
<p>16-18. "The direction from where the petas (corpses), backbiters, murderers, the fierce brigands, and the deceitful are removed, is the direction (to the right of Mount Meru), and is called the quarter of the South. The custodian of this quarter is a great king named Virulha who has a retinue of attendants, and is the sovereign lord of Kumbhandas. Attended by the Kumbhandas he enjoys their song and dance.</p>
<p>19. "Many are his (Virulha's) sons, all of one name, so have I heard. Eighty and ten and one are they, Inda their names, and mighty are they.</p>
<p>20. "They too, beholding the Buddha &mdash; Kinsman of the sun, mighty and fearless &mdash; salute him from afar: 'Homage to thee, who art unique among mankind; glory to thee, the highest among men.'</p>
<p>21-22. "As by thy omniscience, thou hast looked on (mankind with a knowing eye), even the non-humans pay reverence to thee. This we have often heard. We, therefore, request the Yakkhas to pay homage to Gotama, the Conqueror (the Buddha). They too say: 'We reverence, Gotama, the Conqueror, we reverence Gotama who is endowed with knowledge and virtue.'</p>
<p>23-24. "When the resplendent sun &mdash; offspring of Aditi &mdash; with its full orb, sets, then the day ceases, and it is called night. The direction where the sun sets (is the West). There exists the ocean deep and vast.</p>
<p>25. "This &mdash; a spreading sheet of water &mdash; they know as the ocean. Where there is West (to the West of Mount Meru) they say that quarter is West.</p>
<p>26. "Custodians of this quarter is a great king named Virupakkha who has a retinue of attendants, and is sovereign lord of the Nagas.</p>
<p>27. "Attended by Nagas he enjoys their song and dance. Many are his (Virupakkha's) sons, all of one name, so have I heard.</p>
<p>28-29. "Eighty and ten and one are they, Inda their name, and mighty are they. They too, beholding the Buddha &mdash; Kinsman of the sun, mighty and fearless &mdash; salute him from afar: 'Homage to thee, who art unique among mankind; glory to thee, the noblest among men.'</p>
<p>30-31. "As by thy omniscience, thou hast looked on (mankind with a knowing eye), even the non-humans pay reverence to thee. This we have often heard. We, therefore, request the Yakkhas to pay homage to Gotama, the Conqueror (the Buddha). They too say: 'We reverence, Gotama, the Conqueror, we reverence Gotama who is endowed with knowledge and virtue.'</p>
<p>32. "Where lies delightful Uttarakuru (the Northern continent), where towers beautiful Mount Meru, there are born men who are selfless and unattached.</p>
<p>33. "They neither sow the seed nor use<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-8' id='fnt-s24-8'>[8]</a> the plow. Spontaneously grown corn is there for them to enjoy.</p>
<p>34. "The rice, purged of the red powder and of husk, clean and sweet-scented, is boiled in golden vessels; it is this that they partake of.</p>
<p>35. "They make of cows a single-seated mount (like mounting on horseback)<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-9' id='fnt-s24-9'>[9]</a> and ride about from place to place.</p>
<p>36-37. "They make use of women and men, girls and boys as vehicles, and travel from place to place in them.</p>
<p>38. "Mounting on vehicles (on elephants and horses) they (the Yakkhas of King Vessavana) travel in every direction.</p>
<p>39. "This king who has a retinue of attendants, is possessed of elephants and horses on which he rides. He also has celestial chariots, palaces, and palanquins. He has cities well built in the celestial regions.</p>
<p>"Their names are Atanata, Kusinata, Parakusinata, Natapuriya, Parakusitanata. To the North, the city of Kapilavata, to the South<a class='noteTag' href='#fn-s24-10' id='fnt-s24-10'>[10]</a> Janogha, and cities named Navanavati, Ambara-ambaravati and the kingdom of Alakamanda. Happy one (addressing the Buddha), this Kuvera (another name for Vessavana) has a kingdom named Visna, therefore, the great king Kuvera is called Vessavana. There are Yakkhas (of this king) who hold investigations and make them known. They are Tatola, Tattala, Tatotala, Ojasi, Tejasi, Tatojasi, Suro, Raja (Sura-raja) Arittho, Nemi (Arittha-nemi). There (in Visana kingdom) lies the lake Dharani whence rain-clouds (drawing water) pour them forth. And there is also the hall named Bhagalavati where the Yakkhas assemble.</p>
<p>40. "There (round about the hall) are trees bearing perpetual fruit. (On these trees) there are multitudes of birds. There also is heard the cry of peacocks and herons, and the melodious song of kokilas (the Indian cuckoo).</p>
<p>41. "There (near the lake) the cry of the birds, who call 'Live ye! Live ye!' <i>(jivamjivaka)</i> is heard. The bird <i>Otthavacittaka</i> ('O lift your hearts!'), the jungle fowls, the crabs and the Pokkharasataka birds roam the woods.</p>
<p>42. "There the cry of the parrot, the myna-birds and the dandamanavaka birds is heard. And Kuvera's lotus-lake ever lies in her beauty in all seasons.</p>
<p>43-44. "That direction (to the North of Mount Meru) is called by people the quarter of the North. The custodian of this quarter is a great king named Kuvera who has a retinue of attendants, and is sovereign lord of the Yakkhas. Attended by the Yakkhas he enjoys their songs and dance.</p>
<p>45. "Many are his (Kuvera's) sons, all of one name, so have I heard. Eighty and ten and one are they, Inda their names, and mighty are they.</p>
<p>46. "They too, beholding the Buddha, kinsman of the sun, mighty and fearless, salute him from afar: 'Homage to thee, who art unique among mankind! Glory to thee, the noblest among men.'</p>
<p>47-48. "As by thy pure omniscience thou hast looked on (mankind); even the non-humans pay reverence to thee, this we have heard. We, therefore, request the Yakkhas to pay homage to Gotama, the Conqueror (the Buddha). They, too, say, 'We reverence Gotama, the Conqueror, we reverence Gotama who is endowed with knowledge and virtue.'</p>
<p>"Happy One, this is the Atanata protection whereby both the monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen may live at ease, guarded, protected, and unharmed.</p>
<p>"If any monk or nun, layman or laywoman learns by heart this Atanata protection, and be word-perfect in repeating it, and if any non-human male or female Yakkha, youth or maiden Yakkha, Yakkha Minister or any Yakkha, or Yakkha attendant; male or female Gandhabba... (as before); male or female Kumbhanda... male or female Naga... were to walk with him or her, or stand or sit or lie down with him or her with malevolent intent, such a non-human, Happy One, will not obtain hospitality from any town or township, will not obtain a place to dwell, nor could live in the Kingdom of Alakamanda. He will not be able to attend the meetings of the Yakkhas. Further he would not be accepted or given in marriage, he would be reproached (by casting remarks on his deformed teeth or eyes or any part of the body), and the non-humans would put an empty bowl over his head and split it (head) in seven pieces.</p>
<p>"Happy One, there are non-humans who are fierce, violent, given to retaliation; those non-humans heed neither the (four) great kings, nor their ministers nor their attendants. They are called rebels against the (four) great kings. Even as in the kingdom of Magadha, the thieves heed neither the king of Magadha, nor the ministers, nor their attendants, and are called rebels against the king of Magadha, so there are non-humans who are fierce... (as before). They are called rebels against the (four) great kings.</p>
<p>"Happy One, if any non-human &mdash; male or female Yakkha, youth or maiden Yakkha, yakkha minister or any Yakkha, or Yakkha attendant; male or female Gandhabba... (as before); male or female Kumbhanda... male or female Naga... were to walk with a monk or nun, or a layman or laywoman, or stand, or sit, or lie down with him or her with malevolent intent, then should (the molested one) inform, cry aloud and shout to those Yakkhas, to the mighty Yakkhas, their commanders and chief commanders saying: 'This Yakkha is seizing me, takes possession of me, is harassing me, assailing me, is harming me, harming me intensely and would not let me go!'</p>
<p>"Who are the Yakkhas, mighty Yakkhas and commanders, and chief commanders (to whom such appeal should be made)?</p>

<p>"These are the Yakkhas, mighty Yakkhas, the commanders, the chief commanders to whom (the molested one) should inform, cry aloud and shout saying: 'This Yakkha is seizing me, takes possession of me, is harassing me, assailing me, is harming me, and harming me intensely, and this Yakkha would not let me go!'</p>
<p>"This, Happy One, is the Atanata protection whereby monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen may live at ease, guarded, protected, and unharmed.</p>
<p>"Happy One, we now take our leave of you; for we have many duties to attend to (so said the four Great Kings)."</p>
<p>"Great Kings, it is time for your departure" (replied the Buddha).</p>
<p>The four great kings arose from their seats, and saluting the Blessed One, circled round him on his right side, and there and then vanished. From among the (attendant) Yakkhas some arose from their seats, and saluted the Blessed One, circled round him on his right side, and there and then vanished; some exchanged greetings with the Blessed One conversing in a friendly and courteous manner, and there and then vanished; some saluted the Blessed One with clasped hands, and there and then vanished; some announced their name and lineage, and there and then vanished; some in silence there and then vanished.</p>
<p>When the night had passed the Blessed One addressed the monks: (The Buddha related to the monks word for word what has been said by the great King Vessavana, see above.) "Learn by heart, monks, the Atanata protection, constantly make use of it, bear it in mind. This Atanata protection, monks, pertains to your welfare, and by virtue of it, monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen may live at ease, guarded, protected, and unharmed."</p>
<p>This the Blessed One said. Those monks glad at heart rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One.</p>

<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-1' id='fn-s24-1'>1</a>.</b> <i>D.</i> No. 32.</p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-2' id='fn-s24-2'>2</a>.</b> They are Dhatarattha, Virulha, Virupakkha, and Vessavana, presiding over the four quarters in the celestial regions.</p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-3' id='fn-s24-3'>3</a>.</b> Vessavana, king of the Northern quarter, according to the Commentary, was familiar with the Buddha, expert in conversation and well-disciplined, and thus he became the spokesman. Kuvera is another name for Vessavana. <!--See above, p. 75, <a href="#s18-stanza27">stanza 27</a>-->.</p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-4' id='fn-s24-4'>4</a>.</b> According to Dighanikaya-attakatha-tika (vol iii, p. 194), King Vessavana had a town by the name of Atanata<!-- (cf. below, stanza <a href="#s24-stanza39">39</a>)-->, where the four kings assembled and recited this Paritta which speaks of the virtues of the seven Buddhas: Vipassi, Sikhi, Vessabhu, Kakusanda, Konagama, Kassapa, Gotama.</p>
<p>They approached the Buddha with the intention of obtaining his approval in which event, they felt, that this Paritta will attain a revered position: <i>"satthu kathite imam parittam garu bhavissatiti pi aha"</i> (Comy).</p>
<p>Learn, <i>ugganhatha:</i> There is nothing for the Buddha to learn afresh. As the Commentary says, it was to create an opportunity for the Buddha to listen to the discourse, <i>"Imam parittam savetum okasam karonto evamha."</i></p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-5' id='fn-s24-5'>5</a>.</b> <i>Vijja-carana:</i> literally science and conduct.</p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-6' id='fn-s24-6'>6</a>.</b> From the 13th stanza I have adopted the method of numbering the stanzas in consecutive order.</p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-7' id='fn-s24-7'>7</a>.</b> <i>Kusalena,</i> an unusual phrase: "omniscience," "pure wisdom," "sublime wisdom" (Comy).</p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-8' id='fn-s24-8'>8</a>.</b> <i>Na piniyanti,</i> literally they do not carry the plough.</p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-9' id='fn-s24-9'>9</a>.</b> <i>Tam pittim abhiruyha,</i> mounting on the back (Comy).</p>



<p><b><a href='#fnt-s24-10' id='fn-s24-10'>10</a>.</b> <i>Etassa aparabhage</i> (Com).</p>

<div class='chapter'>
<p>The Digha Nikaya, or "Collection of Long Discourses" (Pali <i>digha</i> = "long") is the first division of the <a href="../index.html">Sutta Pitaka</a>, and consists of thirty-four suttas, grouped into three <i>vaggas,</i> or divisions:</p>
<ol>

<li>Silakkhandha-vagga &mdash; The Division Concerning Morality (13 suttas)</li>

<li>Maha-vagga &mdash; The Large Division (10 suttas)</li>

<li>Patika-vagga &mdash; The Patika Division (11 suttas)</li>
</ol>
<p>An excellent modern translation of the complete Digha Nikaya is Maurice Walshe's <i>The Long Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Digha Nikaya</i> (formerly titled: <i>Thus Have I Heard)</i> (Boston: <a href="./../../sources.html#wisdom" title='Get contact info for Wisdom Publications'>Wisdom Publications</a>, 1987). A fine anthology of selected suttas is <i>Handful of Leaves</i> (Vol. 1), by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (distributed by the <a href="./../../sources.html#pts" title='Get contact info for PTS'>PTS</a>).</p>
<p>The translator appears in the square brackets []. The braces {} contain the volume and starting page number in the <a href="./../../sources.html#pts" title='Get contact info for PTS'>PTS</a> romanized Pali edition.</p>

	<div class='sutta_summary'>This discourse explores the role of miracles and conversations with heavenly beings as a possible basis for faith and belief. The Buddha does not deny the reality of such experiences, but he points out that &mdash; of all possible miracles &mdash; the only reliable one is the miracle of instruction in the proper training of the mind. As for heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion, and so the information they give &mdash; especially with regard to the miracle of instruction &mdash; is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus the only valid basis for faith is the instruction that, when followed, brings about the end of one's own mental defilements. The tale that concludes the discourse is one of the finest examples of the early Buddhist sense of humor. <span class='summary_source'>[This summary provided by the translator.]</span> </div>
